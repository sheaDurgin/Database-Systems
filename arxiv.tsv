[2101.10000] Hydrodynamic fluctuations and long-time tails in a fluid on an anisotropic background	Ashish Shukla	Institute for Theoretical Physics 31 Caroline Street North Waterloo Ontario N2L 2Y5 Canada	ashukla@perimeterinstitute.ca	The effective low-energy late-time description of many body systems near thermal equilibrium provided by classical hydrodynamics in terms of dissipative transport phenomena receives important corrections once the effects of stochastic fluctuations are taken into account. One such physical effect is the occurrence of long-time power law tails in correlation functions of conserved currents. In the hydrodynamic regimethis amounts to non-analytic dependence of the correlation functions on the frequency. In this article, we consider a relativistic fluid with a conserved globalcharge in the presence of a strong background magnetic field, and compute the long-time tails in correlation functions of the stress tensor. The presence of the magnetic field renders the system anisotropic. In the absence of the magnetic field, there are three out-of-equilibrium transport parameters that arise at the first order in the hydrodynamic derivative expansion, all of which are dissipative. In the presence of a background magnetic field, there are ten independent out-of-equilibrium transport parameters at the first order, three of which are non-dissipative and the rest are dissipative. We provide the most general linearized equations about a given state of thermal equilibrium involving the various transport parameters in the presence of a magnetic field, and use them to compute the long-time tails for the fluid.

[2101.10001] Diverse Adversaries for Mitigating Bias in Training	Xudong Han&Timothy BaldwinSchool of Computing and Information SystemsThe University of MelbourneVictoria 3010,  Cohn		xudongh1@student.unimelb.edu.au	Adversarial learning can learn fairer and less biased models of language than standard methods. However, current adversarial techniques only partially mitigate model bias, added to which their training procedures are often unstable. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to adversarial learning based on the use of multiplediversediscriminators, whereby discriminators are encouraged to learn orthogonal hidden representations from one another. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves over standard adversarial removal methods, in terms of reducing bias and the stability of training.	
[2101.10002] Securing Full-Duplex Amplify-and-Forward Relay-Aided Transmissions Through Processing-Time Optimization	Mohamed Marzban, Ahmed El Shafie, Ahmed Sultan, Naofal Al-DhahirUniversity of Texas at Dallas, USA.Qualcomm Inc, CA, USA.King Abdullah University of Science and Technology , Saudi Arabia.			We investigate physical-layer security of the full-duplex (FD) amplify-and-forward (AF) relay channel. We provide a new perspective on the problem and show that the processing time (delay) at the relay can be exploited to improve the system’s security. We show that the FD AF relay channel can be seen as an intersymbol-interference (ISI) channel, hence, the discrete-Fourier transform (DFT) can be used for data modulation and demodulation to convert the frequency-selective channel into flat-fading channel per sub-channel/sub-carrier. By exploiting the fact that the channel memory needs to be cleared by inserting the cyclic-prefix, Alice injects an artificial-noise (AN) signal that hurts the eavesdropping nodes only. The strength of this AN signal and its interference rank are controlled by the relay’s processing time.	
[2101.10003] Sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array to dark subhalos	Javier Coronado-Blázquez Michele Doro Miguel A. Sánchez-Conde Alejandra Aguirre-Santaella		alejandra.aguirre@uam.es miguel.sanchezconde@uam.es michele.doro@unipd.it javier.coronado@uam.es	In this work, we study the potential of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) for the detection of Galactic dark matter (DM) subhalos. We focus on low-mass subhalos that do not host any baryonic content and therefore lack any multiwavelength counterpart. If the DM is made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), these dark subhalos may thus appear in the gamma-ray sky as unidentified sources. A detailed characterization of the instrumental response of CTA to dark subhalos is performed, for which we use thectoolsanalysis software and simulate CTA observations under different array configurations and pointing strategies, such as the scheduled extragalactic survey. This, together with information on the subhalo population as inferred from N-body cosmological simulations, allows us to predict the CTA detectability of dark subhalos, i.e., the expected number of subhalos in each of the considered observational scenarios. In the absence of detection, for each observation strategy we set competitive limits to the annihilation cross section as a function of the DM particle mass, that are at the level of()for the() annihilation channel in the best case scenario. Interestingly, we find the latter to be reached with no dedicated observations, as we obtain the best limits by just accumulating exposure time from all scheduled CTA programs and pointings over the first 10 years of operation. This way CTA will offer the most constraining limits from subhalo searches in the intermediate range betweenTeV, complementing previous results withFermi-LAT and HAWC at lower and higher energies, respectively.

[2101.10005] Low incidence rate of COVID-19 undermines confidence in estimation of the vaccine efficacy	Yasin Memari	Cancer Unit University of Cambridge Cambridge CB2 0XZ UK	ym255@cam.ac.uk	Knowing the true effect size of clinical interventions in randomised clinical trials is key to informing the public health policies. Vaccine efficacy is defined in terms of the relative risk or the ratio of two disease risks. However, only approximate methods are available for estimating the variance of the relative risk. In this article, we show using a probabilistic model that uncertainty in the efficacy rate could be underestimated when the disease risk is low. Factoring in the baseline rate of the disease, we estimate broader confidence intervals for the efficacy rates of the vaccines recently developed for COVID-19. We propose new confidence intervals for the relative risk. We further show that sample sizes required for phase 3 efficacy trials are routinely underestimated and propose a new method for sample size calculation where the efficacy is of interest. We also discuss the deleterious effects of classification bias which is particularly relevant at low disease prevalence.	
[2101.10006] Continuum modeling perspectives of non-Fourier heat conduction in biological systems	Á. Sudár, G. Futaki, R. Kovács	Department of Energy Engineering Faculty of Mechanical Engineering BME Budapest HungaryDepartment of Theoretical Physics Wigner Research Centre for Physics Institute for Particle and Nuclear Physics Budapest HungaryMontavid Thermodynamic Research Group		The thermal modeling of biological systems has increasing importance in developing more advanced, more precise techniques such as ultrasound surgery. One of the primary barriers is the complexity of biological materials: the geometrical, structural, and material properties vary in a wide range, and they depend on many factors. Despite these difficulties, there is a tremendous effort to develop a reliable and implementable thermal model. In the present paper, we focus on the continuum modeling of heterogeneous materials with biological origin. There are numerous examples in the literature for non-Fourier thermal models. However, as we realized, they are associated with a few common misconceptions. Therefore, we first aim to clarify the basic concepts of non-Fourier thermal models. These concepts are demonstrated by revisiting two experiments from the literature in which the Cattaneo-Vernotte and the dual phase lag models are utilized. Our investigation revealed that using these non-Fourier models is based on misinterpretations of the measured data, and the seeming deviation from Fourier’s law originates in the source terms and boundary conditions.

[2101.10007] Adaptive Scheduling for Machine Learning Tasks over Networks	Konstantinos Gatsis	The author is with the Department of Engineering Science University of Oxford Parks Road Oxford OX1 3PJ UK. Email:	konstantinos.gatsis@eng.ox.ac.uk	A key functionality of emerging connected autonomous systems such as smart transportation systems, smart cities, and the industrial Internet-of-Things, is the ability to process and learn from data collected at different physical locations. This is increasingly attracting attention under the terms of distributed learning and federated learning. However, in this setup data transfer takes place over communication resources that are shared among many users and tasks or subject to capacity constraints. This paper examines algorithms for efficiently allocating resources to linear regression tasks by exploiting the informativeness of the data. The algorithms developed enable adaptive scheduling of learning tasks with reliable performance guarantees.	
[2101.10008] SEA-BREW: A Scalable Attribute-Based Encryption Scheme for Low-Bitrate IoT Wireless Networks	Michele La Manna, Pericle Perazzo, Gianluca Dini			Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is an emerging cryptographic technique that allows one to embed a fine-grained access control mechanism into encrypted data. In this paper we propose a novel ABE scheme called SEA-BREW (Scalable and Efficient Abe with Broadcast REvocation for Wireless networks), which is suited for Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) applications. In contrast to state-of-the-art ABE schemes, ours is capable of securely performing key revocations with a single short broadcast message, instead of a number of unicast messages that is linear with the number of nodes. This is desirable for low-bitrate Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) which often are the heart of (I)IoT systems. In SEA-BREW, sensors, actuators, and users can exchange encrypted data via a cloud server, or directly via wireless if they belong to the same WSAN. We formally prove that our scheme is secure also in case of an untrusted cloud server that colludes with a set of users, under the generic bilinear group model. We show by simulations that our scheme requires a constant computational overhead on the cloud server with respect to the complexity of the access control policies. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art solutions, which require instead a linear computational overhead.	
[2101.10009] Optimized effective potentials from the random-phase approximation: Accuracy of the quasiparticle approximation	Stefan Riemelmoser Merzuk Kaltak Georg Kresse	of Physics and Center for Computational Materials Science University of Vienna Kolingasse 14-16 A-1090 Vienna Austria	stefan.riemelmoser@univie.ac.at	The optimized effective potential (OEP) method presents an unambiguous way to construct the Kohn-Sham potential corresponding to a given diagrammatic approximation for the exchange-correlation functional. The OEP from the random-phase approximation (RPA) has played an important role ever since the conception of the OEP formalism. However, the solution of the OEP equation is computationally fairly expensive and has to be done in a self-consistent way. So far, large scale solid state applications have therefore been performed only using the quasiparticle approximation (QPA), neglecting certain dynamical screening effects. We obtain the exact RPA-OEP for 15 semiconductors and insulators by direct solution of the linearized Sham-Schlüter equation. We investigate the accuracy of the QPA on Kohn-Sham band gaps and dielectric constants, and comment on the issue of self-consistency.

This catalog contains 45Fermi-LAT solar flares (FLSFs) with emission in the-ray energy bandMeV -GeVdetected with a significance5over the years 2010-2018. A subsample containing 37 of these flares exhibit delayed emission beyond the prompt-impulsive hard X-ray phase with 21 flares showing delayed emission lasting more than two hours. No prompt-impulsive emission is detected in four of these flares. We also present in this catalog the observations of GeV emission from 3 flares originating from Active Regions located behind the limb (BTL) of the visible solar disk. We report the light curves, spectra, best proton index and localization (when possible) for all the FLSFs. The-ray spectra is consistent with the decay of pions produced by300 MeV protons. This work contains the largest sample of high-energy-ray flares ever reported and provides the unique opportunity to perform population studies on the different phases of the flare and thus allowing to open a new window in solar physics.

In this Letter we introduce a new family of superhard materials, ""fused borophenes"", containing 2D boron layers which are interlinked to form a 3D network. These materials, identified through a high-throughput scan of BCstructures, exhibit Vicker’s hardnesses comparable to those of the best commercial metal borides. Due to their low formation enthalpies, fused borophenes could be synthesized by high-temperature methods, starting from appropriate precursors, or through quenching of high-pressure phases."	
[2101.10014] A Simple Disaster-Related Knowledge Base for Intelligent Agents	Clark Emmanuel Paulo, Arvin Ken Ramirez, David Clarence ReducindoRannie Mark Mateo, Joseph Marvin ImperialNational UniversityManila,		jrimperial@national-u.edu.ph	In this paper, we describe our efforts in establishing a simple knowledge base by building a semantic network composed of concepts and word relationships in the context of disasters in the Philippines. Our primary source of data is a collection of news articles scraped from various Philippine news websites. Using word embeddings, we extract semantically similar and co-occurring words from an initial seed words list. We arrive at an expanded ontology with a total of 450 word assertions. We let experts from the fields of linguistics, disasters, and weather science evaluate our knowledge base and arrived at an agreeability rate of 64%. We then perform a time-based analysis of the assertions to identify important semantic changes captured by the knowledge base such as the (a) trend of roles played by human entities, (b) memberships of human entities, and (c) common association of disaster-related words. The context-specific knowledge base developed from this study can be adapted by intelligent agents such as chat bots integrated in platforms such as Facebook Messenger for answering disaster-related queries.

It is an integrated hardware-software system. The first generation product with two qubits was launched in January 2020. The hardware is based on NMR spectrometer, with permanent magnets providingT magnetic field. SpinQ Gemini operates under room temperature (-C), highlighting its lightweight (55 kg with a volume ofcm), cost-effective (underk USD), and maintenance-free. SpinQ Gemini aims to provide real-device experience for quantum computing education for K-12 and at the college level. It also features quantum control design capabilities that benefit the researchers studying quantum control and quantum noise. Since its first launch, SpinQ Gemini has been shipped to institutions in Canada, Taiwan and Mainland China. This paper introduces the system of design of SpinQ Gemini, from hardware to software. We also demonstrate examples for performing quantum computing tasks on SpinQ Gemini, including one task for a variational quantum eigensolver of a two-qubit Heisenberg model. The next generations of SpinQ quantum computing devices will adopt models of more qubits, advanced control functions for researchers with comparable cost, as well as simplified models for much lower cost (underk USD) for K-12 education. We believe that low-cost portable quantum computer products will facilitate hands-on experience for teaching quantum computing at all levels, well-prepare younger generations of students and researchers for the future of quantum technologies.	pacs:03.65.Ud | 03.67.Dd | 03.67.Mn

[2101.10019] Star formation quenching stages of active and non-active galaxies	V. Kalinova D. Colombo S. F. Sánchez K. Kodaira R. García-Benito R. González Delgado E. Rosolowsky E. A. D. Lacerda	institutetext:		The mechanisms that bring galaxies to strongly reduce their star formation activity (star-formation quenching) is still poorly understood. To better study galaxy evolution, we propose a classification based on the maps of the ionised hydrogen distribution, traced by kpc-resolved, equivalent width of Hmaps, and the nuclear activity of the galaxies using information from the Baldwin-Philips-Terlevich (BPT) diagnostic diagrams. Using these tools, we group a sample of 238 galaxies from the CALIFA (Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field spectroscopy Area) survey in six quenching stages (QS): (i) objects dominated by recent star formation; (ii) systems that present a quiescent-nuclear-ring structure in their centre; (iii) galaxies that are centrally-quiescent; (iv) galaxies with no clear pattern in their ionisation gas distributionmixed; (v) systems that posses only a few star-forming regionsnearly-retired, or (vi) galaxies that are completely quiescentfully-retired. Regarding their nuclear activity, we further divide the galaxies into two groupsactive systems that host a weak or strong Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in their centre, and non-active objects. Galaxies grouped into quenching stage classes occupy specific locations on the star-formation-rate versus stellar mass diagram. The “Blue cloud” is populated by the star-forming and the quiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, the “Green valley” is populated by centrally-quiescent and mixed systems, “Red sequence” by the nearly- and fully-retired objects. Generally, galaxies that host a weak or strong AGN show properties, comparable to the non-active counterparts at the same quenching stages, except for the AGN-hosting star-forming systems. The degree of the star-formation quenching increases along the present emission-line pattern sequence from star-forming to fully-retired. The proposed emission-line classes reinforce the ”inside-out” quenching scenario, which foresees that the suppression of the star-formation begins from the central regions of the galaxies.

However, most existing apps are not grounded in social comparison theories and do not consider individual differences in social comparison preferences and reactions. This paper is among the first to automatically personalize social comparison targets. In the context of an m-health app for physical activity, we use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques of multi-armed bandits. Results from our user study (n=53) indicate that there is some evidence that motivation can be increased using the AI-based personalization of social comparison. The detected effects achieved small-to-moderate effect sizes, illustrating the real-world implications of the intervention for enhancing motivation and physical activity. In addition to design implications for social comparison features in social apps, this paper identified thepersonalization paradox, the conflict between user modeling and adaptation, as a key design challenge of personalized applications for behavior change. Additionally, we propose research directions to mitigate this Personalization Paradox.	personalization | physical activity | social comparison | m-health

The setting where nodes are partitioned into subsets, each allowing for local recovery, is well understood. In this work we consider a generalization introduced by Gopalan et al., where, viewing the codewords as arrays, constraints are imposed on the columns and rows in addition to some global constraints. Specifically, we present a generic method of adding such global parity-checks and derive new results on the set of correctable erasure patterns. Finally, we relate the set of correctable erasure patterns in the considered topology to those correctable in tensor-product codes.

[2101.10030] Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection with Robust Temporal Feature Magnitude Learning	Yu TianGuansong PangYuanhong ChenRajvinder SinghJohan W. VerjansGustavo CarneiroAustralian Institute for Machine Learning, University of AdelaideFaculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of AdelaideSouth Australian Health and Medical Research Institute			Anomaly detection with weakly supervised video-level labels is typically formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, in which we aim to identify snippets containing abnormal events, with each video represented as a bag of video snippets. Although current methods show effective detection performance, their recognition of the positive instances, i.e., rare abnormal snippets in the abnormal videos, is largely biased by the dominant negative instances, especially when the abnormal events are subtle anomalies that exhibit only small differences compared with normal events. This issue is exacerbated in many methods that ignore important video temporal dependencies. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and theoretically sound method, named Robust Temporal Feature Magnitude learning (RTFM), which trains a feature magnitude learning function to effectively recognise the positive instances, substantially improving the robustness of the MIL approach to the negative instances from abnormal videos. RTFM also adapts dilated convolutions and self-attention mechanisms to capture long- and short-range temporal dependencies to learn the feature magnitude more faithfully. Extensive experiments show that the RTFM-enabled MIL model (i) outperforms several state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on four benchmark data sets (ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime, XD-Violence and UCSD-Peds) and (ii) achieves significantly improved subtle anomaly discriminability and sample efficiency.

The typical user-centered design workflow requires the developers and users to go through many iterations of design, implementation, and analysis. The procedure is inefficient, and human decisions highly bias the results. While computational methods are used to assist various design tasks, there has not been any holistic approach to automate the design of input components. My thesis proposed a series ofComputational Input Designworkflows: I envision a sample-efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm that cleverly selects design instances, which are instantly deployed on physical simulators. A meta-reinforcement learning user model then simulates the user behaviors when using the design instance upon the simulators. The new workflows derive Pareto-optimal designs with high efficiency and automation. I demonstrate designing a push-button via the proposed methods. The resulting designs outperform the known baselines. The Computational Input Design process can be generalized to other devices, such as joystick, touchscreen, mouse, controller, etc.	Input devices; Design workflow; Computational methods; Bayesian optimization; Meta-RL; Meta learning; Reinforcement learning; Button; Physical simulator

In day-to-day work of professional translators, however, it is seldom the case as translators work with bilingual glossaries where terms are given in their dictionary forms; finding the right target language form is part of the translation process. We argue that the requirement for apriori specified target language forms is unrealistic and impedes the practical applicability of previous work. In this work, we propose to train machine translation systems using a source-side data augmentation method111Relevant materials and code:https://github.com/tilde-nlp/terminology_translationthat annotates randomly selected source language words with their target language lemmas. We show that systems trained on such augmented data are readily usable for terminology integration in real-life translation scenarios. Our experiments on terminology translation into the morphologically complex Baltic and Uralic languages show an improvement of up to 7 BLEU points over baseline systems with no means for terminology integration and an average improvement of 4 BLEU points over the previous work. Results of the human evaluation indicate a 47.7% absolute improvement over the previous work in term translation accuracy when translating into Latvian.	
[2101.10036] Dilatancy stabilises shear failure in rock	Franciscus M. Aben, Nicolas BrantutDepartment of Earth SciencesUniversity College London, UK			Failure and fault slip in crystalline rocks is associated with dilation. When pore fluids are present and drainage is insufficient, dilation leads to pore pressure drops, which in turn lead to strengthening of the material. We conducted laboratory rock fracture experiments with direct in-situ fluid pressure measurements which demonstrate that dynamic rupture propagation and fault slip can be stabilised (i.e., become quasi-static) by such a dilatancy strengthening effect. We also observe that, for the same effective pressures but lower pore fluid pressures, the stabilisation process may be arrested when the pore fluid pressure approaches zero and vaporises, resulting in dynamic shear failure. In case of a stable rupture, we witness continued prolonged slip after the main failure event that is the result of pore pressure recharge of the fault zone. All our observations are quantitatively explained by a spring-slider model combining slip-weakening behaviour, slip-induced dilation, and pore fluid diffusion. Using our data in an inverse problem, we estimate the key parameters controlling rupture stabilisation, fault dilation rate and fault zone storage. These estimates are used to make predictions for the pore pressure drop associated with faulting, and where in the crust we may expect dilatancy stabilisation or vaporisation during earthquakes. For intact rock and well consolidated faults, we expect strong dilatancy strengthening between 4 and 6 km depth regardless of ambient pore pressure, and at greater depths when the ambient pore pressure approaches lithostatic pressure. In the uppermost part of the crust (km), we predict vaporisation of pore fluids that limits dilatancy strengthening. The depth estimates where dilatant stabilisation is most likely coincide with geothermal energy reservoirs in crystalline rock (typically between 2 and 5 km depth) and in regions where slow slip events are observed (pore pressure that approaches lithostatic pressure).

The popular forecasting model ARIMA is applied to a large variety of applications for decades. An online variant of ARIMA applies the Online Newton Step in order to learn the underlying process of the time series. This optimization method has pitfalls concerning the computational complexity and convergence. Thus, this work focuses on the computational less expensive Online Gradient Descent optimization method, which became popular for learning of neural networks in recent years. For the iterative training of such models, we propose a new approach combining different Online Gradient Descent learners (such as Adam, AMSGrad, Adagrad, Nesterov) to achieve fast convergence. The evaluation on synthetic data and experimental datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods resulting in an overall lower prediction error.

E-mail: authors are with Department of Electrical Engineering Indian Institute of Technology Madras Chennai India 600036. E-mail:	appina@iiitdm.ac.in	Numerous stereoscopic 3D movies are released every year to theaters and created large revenues. Despite the improvement in stereo capturing and 3D video post-production technology, stereoscopic artifacts which cause viewer discomfort continue to appear even in high-budget films. Existing automatic 3D video quality measurement tools can detect distortions in stereoscopic images or videos, but they fail to consider the viewer’s subjective perception of those artifacts, and how these distortions affect their choices. In this paper, we introduce a novel recommendation system for stereoscopic 3D movies based on a latent factor model that meticulously analyse the viewer’s subjective ratings and influence of 3D video distortions on their preferences. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first-of-its-kind model that recommends 3D movies based on stereo-film-quality ratings accounting correlation between the viewer’s visual discomfort and stereoscopic-artifact perception. The proposed model is trained and tested on benchmark Nama3ds1-cospad1 and LFOVIAS3DPh2 S3D video quality assessment datasets. The experiments revealed that resulting matrix-factorization based recommendation system is able to generalize considerably better for the viewer’s subjective ratings.

[2101.10041] Deep Graph Convolutional Networks for Wind Speed Prediction	Tomasz Stańczyk Siamak Mehrkanoon		t.stanczyk@student.maastrichtuniversity.nl siamak.mehrkanoon@maastrichtuniversity.nl	Wind speed prediction and forecasting is important for various business and management sectors. In this paper, we introduce new models for wind speed prediction based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Given hourly data of several weather variables acquired from multiple weather stations, wind speed values are predicted for multiple time steps ahead. In particular, the weather stations are treated as nodes of a graph whose associated adjacency matrix is learnable. In this way, the network learns the graph spatial structure and determines the strength of relations between the weather stations based on the historical weather data. We add a self-loop connection to the learnt adjacency matrix and normalize the adjacency matrix. We examine two scenarios with the self-loop connection setting (two separate models). In the first scenario, the self-loop connection is imposed as a constant additive. In the second scenario a learnable parameter is included to enable the network to decide about the self-loop connection strength. Furthermore, we incorporate data from multiple time steps with temporal convolution, which together with spatial graph convolution constitutes spatio-temporal graph convolution. We perform experiments on real datasets collected from weather stations located in cities in Denmark and the Netherlands. The numerical experiments show that our proposed models outperform previously developed baseline models on the referenced datasets. We provide additional insights by visualizing learnt adjacency matrices from each layer of our models.

More precisely, we show that weak supersolutions have lower semicontinuous representative. We also prove that the semicontinuous representative at an instant of time is determined by the values at previous times. This gives a pointwise interpretation for a weak supersolution at every point. The corresponding results hold true also for weak subsolutions. Our results extend some recent results in the local parabolic case and in the nonlocal elliptic case to the nonlocal parabolic case. We prove the required energy estimates and measure theoretic De Giorgi type lemmas in the fractional setting.	
[2101.10043] Deep One-Class Classification via Interpolated Gaussian Descriptor	Yuanhong Chen1\equalcontrib, Yu Tian1\equalcontrib, Guansong Pang2, and Gustavo Carneiro1	Corresponding author.		One-class classification (OCC) aims to learn an effective data description to enclose all normal training samples and detect anomalies based on the deviation from the data description. Current state-of-the-art OCC models learn a compact normality description by hyper-sphere minimisation, but they often suffer from overfitting the training data, especially when the training set is small or contaminated with anomalous samples. To address this issue, we introduce the interpolated Gaussian descriptor (IGD) method, a novel OCC model that learns a one-class Gaussian anomaly classifier trained with adversarially interpolated training samples. The Gaussian anomaly classifier differentiates the training samples based on their distance to the Gaussian centre and the standard deviation of these distances, offering the model a discriminability w.r.t. the given samples during training. The adversarial interpolation is enforced to consistently learn a smooth Gaussian descriptor, even when the training data is small or contaminated with anomalous samples. This enables our model to learn the data description based on the representative normal samples rather than fringe or anomalous samples, resulting in significantly improved normality description. In extensive experiments on diverse popular benchmarks, including MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, MVTec AD and two medical datasets, IGD achieves better detection accuracy than current state-of-the-art models. IGD also shows better robustness in problems with small or contaminated training sets.

Specifically, we extend the translation language modellingLample and Conneau (2019)with masked region classification and perform pre-training with three-way parallel vision & language corpora. We show that when fine-tuned for multimodal machine translation, these models obtain state-of-the-art performance.

However, the in-situ electric control of this phenomenon is challenging as it requires a set of conditions to be fulfilled: Special symmetries of the magnetic ground state, spin-excitations with comparable magnetic- and electric-dipole activity and switchable electric polarization.

[2101.10047] On a new formulation for energy transfer between convection and fast tides with application to giant planets and solar type stars	Caroline TerquemDepartment of Physics, Oxford University, Keble Road, Oxford OX1 3RH, UKInstitut d’Astrophysique de Paris, Sorbonne Université, CNRS, UMR 7095, 98 bis boulevard Arago, F-75014, Paris, France		caroline.terquem@physics.ox.ac.uk	All the studies of the interaction between tides and a convective flow assume that the large scale tides can be described as a mean shear flow which is damped by small scale fluctuating convective eddies. The convective Reynolds stress is calculated using mixing length theory, accounting for a sharp suppression of dissipation when the turnover timescale is larger than the tidal period. This yields tidal dissipation rates several orders of magnitude too small to account for the circularization periods of late–type binaries or the tidal dissipation factor of giant planets. Here, we argue that the above description is inconsistent, because fluctuations and mean flow should be identified based on the timescale, not on the spatial scale, on which they vary. Therefore, the standard picture should be reversed, with the fluctuations being the tidal oscillations and the mean shear flow provided by the largest convective eddies. We assume that energy is locally transferred from the tides to the convective flow. Using this assumption, we obtain values for the tidalfactor of Jupiter and Saturn and for the circularization periods of PMS binaries in good agreement with observations. The timescales obtained with the equilibrium tide approximation are however still 40 times too large to account for the circularization periods of late–type binaries. For these systems, shear in the tachocline or at the base of the convective zone may be the main cause of tidal dissipation.	convection – hydrodynamics – Sun: general – planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability – planet–star interactions – binaries: close –

[2101.10049] Optimal control of a nitrogen-vacancy spin ensemble in diamond for sensing in the pulsed domain	Andreas F.L. Poulsen Joshua D. Clement James L. Webb Rasmus H. Jensen Kirstine Berg-Sørensen Alexander Huck Ulrik Lund Andersen	thanks:	alexander.huck@fysik.dtu.dk ulrik.andersen@fysik.dtu.dk jaluwe@fysik.dtu.dk	Defects in solid state materials provide an ideal, robust platform for quantum sensing. To deliver maximum sensitivity, a large ensemble of non-interacting defects hosting coherent quantum states are required. Control of such an ensemble is challenging due to the spatial variation in both the defect energy levels and in any control field across a macroscopic sample. In this work we experimentally demonstrate that we can overcome these challenges using Floquet theory and optimal control optimization methods to efficiently and coherently control a large defect ensemble, suitable for sensing. We apply our methods experimentally to a spin ensemble of up to 410nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. By considering the physics of the system and explicitly including the hyperfine interaction in the optimization, we design shaped microwave control pulses that can outperform conventional (-) pulses when applied to sensing of temperature or magnetic field, with a potential sensitivity improvement between 11 and 78%. Through dynamical modelling of the behaviour of the ensemble, we shed light on the physical behaviour of the ensemble system and propose new routes for further improvement.	
[2101.10050] Learning Parametrised Graph Shift Operators	George Dasoulas, Johannes F. Lutzeyer& Michalis VazirgiannisDaSciM, LIX, École Polytechnique, Institute Polytechnique de Paris, FranceNoah’s Ark Lab, Huawei Technologies FranceAUEB, Greece{georgios.dasoulas,	Equal contribution.	mvazirg@lix.polytechnique.fr	In many domains data is currently represented as graphs and therefore, the graph representation of this data becomes increasingly important in machine learning. Network data is, implicitly or explicitly, always represented using a graph shift operator (GSO) with the most common choices being the adjacency, Laplacian matrices and their normalisations. In this paper, a novel parametrised GSO (PGSO) is proposed, where specific parameter values result in the most commonly used GSOs and message-passing operators in graph neural network (GNN) frameworks. The PGSO is suggested as a replacement of the standard GSOs that are used in state-of-the-art GNN architectures and the optimisation of the PGSO parameters is seamlessly included in the model training. It is proved that the PGSO has real eigenvalues and a set of real eigenvectors independent of the parameter values and spectral bounds on the PGSO are derived. PGSO parameters are shown to adapt to the sparsity of the graph structure in a study on stochastic blockmodel networks, where they are found to automatically replicate the GSO regularisation found in the literature. On several real-world datasets the accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN architectures is improved by the inclusion of the PGSO in both node- and graph-classification tasks.	
[2101.10051] Entropic force between two horizons of dilaton black holes with a power-Maxwell field	Hui-Hua Zhao, Li-Chun  Zhang), corresponding author, Ying Gao, Fang Liu	Institute of Theoretical Physics Shanxi Datong University Datong 037009 ChinaSchool of Mathematics and Statistics Shanxi Datong University Datong 037009 China	zhlc2969@163.com	In this paper, we consider-dimensional topological dilaton de Sitter black holes with power-Maxwell field as thermodynamic systems. The thermodynamic quantities corresponding to the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon respectively are interrelated. So the total entropy of the space-time should be the sum of the entropies of the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon plus a corrected term which is produced by the association of the two horizons. We analyze the entropic force produced by the corrected term at given temperatures, which is affected by parameters and dimensions of the space-time. It is shown that the change of entropic force with the position ratio of two horizons in some region is similar to that of Lennard-Jones force with the position of particles. If the effect of entropic force is similar to that of Lennard-Jones force, and other forces are absent, the motion of the cosmological horizon relative to the black hole horizon would have an oscillating process. The entropic force between the two horizons is probably one of the participants to drive the evolution of universe.	pacs:04.70.-s | 05.70.Ce
[2101.10052] CutFEM Based on Extended Finite Element Spaces	Erik Burman, Peter Hansbo, Mats G. Larson		e.burman@ucl.ac.uk mats.larson@umu.se peter.hansbo@ju.se	We develop a general framework for construction and analysis of discrete extension operators with application to unfitted finite element approximation of partial differential equations. In unfitted methods so called cut elements intersected by the boundary occur and these elements must in general by stabilized in some way. Discrete extension operators provides such a stabilization by modification of the finite element space close to the boundary. More, precisely the finite element space is extended from the stable interior elements over the boundary in a stable way which also guarantees optimal approximation properties. Our framework is applicable to all standard nodal based finite elements of various order and regularity. We develop an abstract theory for elliptic problems and associated parabolic time dependent partial differential equations and derive a priori error estimates. We finally apply this to some examples of partial differential equations of different order including the interface problems, the biharmonic operator and the sixth order triharmonic operator.

The analysis of the energy density condition reveals a splitting brane process satisfying the weak and strong energy conditions for some values of the parametersand. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the gravitational perturbations in this scenario. In the bulk, the torsion keeps a gapless non-localizable and stable tower of massive modes. Inside the brane core the torsion produces new barriers and potential wells leading to small amplitude massive modes and a massless mode localized for some values of the parametersand.

Usually a high number of individual scintillator crystals are either coupled individually to a light sensor or sharing a fewer number of them. In both cases the spatial resolution is limited by the pixel size. The high degree of segmentation in those detectors strongly simplifies the task of locating gamma ray interaction although on the other hand small pixel size degrades energy resolution and time performance. Moreover the scalability of pixel based architecture requires a high cost in terms of material and manufacturing. Other solutions have been proposed in the past[1]based on bigger scintillation crystals where the light distribution sensed by an array of photodetectors was analyzed in order to obtain the gamma event characteristics. However the size and shape of the scintillator crystal cannot be fully customized and large area detectors (body PET scanners) are still difficult to build.

[2101.10057] Localization in the Kicked Ising Chain	Daniel Waltner, Petr Braun	Fakultät für Physik Universität Duisburg-Essen Lotharstraße 1 D-47048 Duisburg Germany		Determining the border between ergodic and localized behavior is of central interest for interacting many-body systems. We consider here the recently very popular spin-chain model that is periodically excited. A convenient description of such a many-body system is achieved by the dual operator that evolves the system in contrast to the time-evolution operator not in time but in particle direction. We identify in this paper the largest eigenvalue of a function based on the dual operator as a convenient tool to determine if the system shows ergodic or many-body localized features. By perturbation theory in the vicinity of the noninteracting system we explain analytically the eigenvalue structure and compare it with numerics in [P. Braun, D. Waltner, M. Akila, B. Gutkin, T. Guhr, Phys. Rev. E101, 052201 (2020)] for small times. Furthermore we identify a quantity that allows based on extensive large-time numerical computations of the spectral form factor to distinguish between localized and ergodic system features and to determine the Thouless time, i.e. the transition time between these regimes in the thermodynamic limit.	
[2101.10058] The EM Perspective of Directional Mean Shift Algorithm	\nameYikun   of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195		yikun@uw.edu yenchic@uw.edu	The directional mean shift (DMS) algorithm is a nonparametric method for pursuing local modes of densities defined by kernel density estimators on the unit hypersphere. In this paper, we show that any DMS iteration can be viewed as a generalized Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm; in particular, when the von Mises kernel is applied, it becomes an exact EM algorithm. Under the (generalized) EM framework, we provide a new proof for the ascending property of density estimates and demonstrate the global convergence of directional mean shift sequences. Finally, we give a new insight into the linear convergence of the DMS algorithm.

The threshold case in which the resonance frequencies of the membrane and the frequencies of thin inclusion coincide is investigated. The perturbed eigenvalue problem can be realized as a family of self-adjoint operators acting on varying Hilbert spaces. However the so-called limit operator is non-self-adjoint and possesses the Jordan chains of length. Apart from the lack of self-adjointness, the operator has non-compact resolvent. As a consequence, its spectrum has a complicated structure, for instance, the spectrum contains a countable set of eigenvalues with infinite multiplicity. The complete asymptotic analysis of eigenvalues has been carried out.

Frasca are with Univ. Grenoble Alpes CNRS Inria Grenoble INP GIPSA-lab 38000 Grenoble France.		In this paper we present a continuation method which transforms spatially distributed ODE systems into continuous PDE. We show that this continuation can be performed both for linear and nonlinear systems, including multidimensional, space- and time-varying systems. When applied to a large-scale network, the continuation provides a PDE describing evolution of continuous state approximation that respects the spatial structure of the original ODE. Our method is illustrated by multiple examples including transport equations, Kuramoto equations and heat diffusion equations. As a main example, we perform the continuation of a Newtonian system of interacting particles and obtain the Euler equations for compressible fluids, thereby providing an original alternative solution to Hilbert’s 6th problem. Finally, we leverage our derivation of the Euler equations to control multiagent systems, designing a nonlinear control algorithm for robot formation based on its continuous approximation.

We also classify the seven-dimensional Lie algebraswith codimension-one ideal equal to the complex Heisenberg Lie algebra which admit exact-structures with or without special torsion. To achieve these goals, we first determine the six-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebrasadmitting an exact-structureor a half-flat-structurewith exact, respectively.

Wang are with College of Computer National University of Defense Technology Changsha 410073 China. E-mail: Xiatian Zhu is with University of Surrey Stag Hill University Campus Guildford GU2 7XH UK. E-mail:	eddy.zhuxt@gmail.com	This work introduces a novel data augmentation method for few-shot website fingerprinting (WF) attack where only a handful of training samples per website are available for deep learning model optimization. Moving beyond earlier WF methods relying on manually-engineered feature representations, more advanced deep learning alternatives demonstrate that learning feature representations automatically from training data is superior. Nonetheless, this advantage is subject to anunrealisticassumption that there exist many training samples per website, which otherwise will disappear. To address this, we introduce a model-agnostic, efficient, andHarmonious Data Augmentation(HDA) method that can improve deep WF attacking methods significantly. HDA involves both intra-sample and inter-sample data transformations that can be used in harmonious manner to expand a tiny training dataset to an arbitrarily large collection, therefore effectively and explicitly addressing the intrinsic data scarcity problem. We conducted expensive experiments to validate our HDA for boosting state-of-the-art deep learning WF attack models in both closed-world and open-world attacking scenarios, at absence and presence of strong defense. For instance, in the more challenging and realistic evaluation scenario with WTF-PAD based defense, our HDA method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art results by more than 4% in absolute classification accuracy in the 20-shot learning case.

[2101.10067] Full-Duplex Reflective Beamsteering Metasurface Featuring Magnetless Nonreciprocal Amplification	Sajjad Taravatiand George V. Eleftheriades		sajjad.taravati@utoronto.ca	Nonreciprocal radiation refers to electromagnetic wave radiation in which a structure provides different responses under the change of the direction of the incident field. Modern wireless telecommunication systems demand versatile apparatuses which are capable of full-duplex nonreciprocal wave processing and amplification, especially in the reflective state. To realize such a unique, extraordinary and versatile functionality, we propose an architecture in which a chain of series cascaded radiating patches are integrated with nonreciprocal phase shifters, providing an original and efficient apparatus for full-duplex reflective beamsteering. Such an ultrathin reflective metasurface can provide directive and diverse radiation beams, large wave amplification, steerable beams by simply changing the bias of the gradient active nonmagnetic nonreciprocal phase shifters, and is immune to undesired time harmonics. Having accomplished all these functionalities in the reflective state, the metasurface represents a conspicuous apparatus for efficient, controllable and programmable wave engineering.

Although progresses have been achieved, existing methods are heuristically motivated and theoretical understanding of such embeddings is comparatively underdeveloped. This paper extends the random walk modelArora et al. (2016a)of word embeddings to Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to derive a scoring function that evaluates the strength of a relationbetween two entities(head) and(tail). Moreover, we show that marginal loss minimisation, a popular objective used in much prior work in KGE, follows naturally from the log-likelihood ratio maximisation under the probabilities estimated from the KGEs according to our theoretical relationship. We propose a learning objective motivated by the theoretical analysis to learn KGEs from a given knowledge graph. Using the derived objective, accurate KGEs are learnt from FB15K237 and WN18RR benchmark datasets, providing empirical evidence in support of the theory.

This concept emerged several years ago and is being adopted by a rapidly-growing number of educational institutions around the globe. In recent years, the boost of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), together with the advances in big data analysis, has unfolded novel perspectives to enhance personalized education in numerous dimensions. By taking advantage of AI/ML methods, the educational platform precisely acquires the student’s characteristics. This is done, in part, by observing the past experiences as well as analyzing the available big data through exploring the learners’ features and similarities. It can, for example, recommend the most appropriate content among numerous accessible ones, advise a well-designed long-term curriculum, connect appropriate learners by suggestion, accurate performance evaluation, and the like. Still, several aspects of AI-based personalized education remain unexplored. These include, among others, compensating for the adverse effects of the absence of peers, creating and maintaining motivations for learning, increasing the diversity, removing the biases induced by the data and algorithms, and the like. In this paper, while providing a brief review of state-of-the-art research, we investigate the challenges of AI/ML-based personalized education, and discuss potential solutions.	Keywords

Here we suggest a paradigm for optically induced nonreciprocity in semiconductor wires which are spatially asymmetry-free and provide a very simple and efficient platform for plasmonic devices. An azimuthal magnetic field induced by a plasmonic pump in the semiconductor wire alters the material parameters and thus results in a cross-nonlinear modulation of the plasmonic signal. Peculiarly the nonlinear wavenumber shift has opposite signs for forward and backward signals whereas Kerr or Kerr-like nonlinearity does not break Lorentz reciprocity in spatially symmetric structures. This principle may open an avenue towards highly integrated all-optical nonreciprocal devices.

Here, we introduce a more accessible approach, namely the ancestral initiation graph. The construction is based on a discretisation of the selection-recombination equation. We apply our method to systematically explain a long-standing observation concerning the dynamics of linkage disequilibrium between two neutral loci hitchhiking along with a selected one. In particular, this clarifies the nontrivial dependence on the position of the selected site.

Burke-Spolaor	institutetext:	stefan.oslowski@gmail.com verbiest@physik.uni-bielefeld.de sarahbspolaor@gmail.com	Pulsar timing is a technique that uses the highly stable spin periods of neutron stars to investigate a wide range of topics in physics and astrophysics. Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) use sets of extremely well-timed pulsars as a Galaxy-scale detector with arms extending between Earth and each pulsar in the array. These challenging experiments look for correlated deviations in the pulsars’ timing that are caused by low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) traversing our Galaxy. PTAs are particularly sensitive to GWs at nanohertz frequencies, which makes them complementary to other space- and ground-based detectors. In this chapter, we will describe the methodology behind pulsar timing; provide an overview of the potential uses of PTAs; and summarise where current PTA-based detection efforts stand. Most predictions expect PTAs to successfully detect a cosmological background of GWs emitted by supermassive black-hole binaries and also potentially detect continuous-wave emission from binary supermassive black holes, within the next several years.

Because of the ultrashort pulse duration, the XFEL-produced plasma will be out of equilibrium at the beginning and even the electronic subsystem may not reach thermal equilibrium while interacting with a femtosecond time-scale pulse. In the dense plasma, the ionization potential depression (IPD) induced by the plasma environment plays a crucial role for understanding and modeling microscopic dynamical processes. However, all theoretical approaches for IPD have been based on local thermal equilibrium (LTE) and it has been controversial to use LTE IPD models for the nonthermal situation. In this work, we propose a non-LTE (NLTE) approach to calculate the IPD effect by combining a quantum-mechanical electronic-structure calculation and a classical molecular dynamics simulation. This hybrid approach enables us to investigate the time evolution of ionization potentials and IPDs during and after the interaction with XFEL pulses, without the limitation of the LTE assumption. In our NLTE approach, the transient IPD values are presented as distributions evolving with time, which cannot be captured by conventional LTE-based models. The time-integrated ionization potential values are in good agreement with benchmark experimental data on solid-density aluminum plasma and other theoretical predictions based on LTE. The present work is promising to provide critical insights into nonequilibrium dynamics of dense plasma formation and thermalization induced by XFEL pulses.	pacs:34.50.-s | 34.70.+e

However, analyzing program structure by hand is time-consuming, and teachers need better tools for computer-assisted exploration of student solutions. As a first step towards an education-oriented program analysis toolkit, we show how supervised machine learning methods can automatically classify student programs into a predetermined set of high-level structures. We evaluate two models on classifying student solutions to the Rainfall problem: a nearest-neighbors classifier using syntax tree edit distance and a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that these models can achieve 91% classification accuracy when trained on 108 programs. We further explore the generality, trade-offs, and failure cases of each model.

Bose Centre for Cryptology and Security Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata 700108 India	goutam.paul@isical.ac.in soumya06.das@gmail.com abanerji09@gmail.com	Hyper-hybrid entanglement for two indistinguishable bosons has been recently proposed by Liet al.[Y. Li, M. Gessner, W. Li, and A. Smerzi,Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 050404 (2018)]. In the current paper, we show that this entanglement exists for two indistinguishable fermions also. Next, we establish twono-goresults: no hyper-hybrid entanglement for twodistinguishableparticles, and no unit fidelity quantum teleportation usingindistinguishableparticles. If either of these is possible, then theno-signaling principlewould be violated. While several earlier works have attempted extending many results on distinguishable particles to indistinguishable ones, and vice versa, the above two no-go results establish a nontrivial separation between the two domains. Finally, we propose an efficient entanglement swapping using only two indistinguishable particles, whereas a minimum number of either three distinguishable or four indistinguishable particles is necessary for existing protocols.

Such variances could capture the collective effects of household impacts, disrupted accesses, and business closures, and thus provide an integrative measure for examining disaster impacts and community recovery in disasters. Existing studies depend mainly on survey and sociodemographic data for disaster impacts and recovery effort evaluations, although such data has limitations, including large data collection efforts and delayed timeliness results. In addition, there are very few studies have concentrated on spatial patterns and disparities of disaster impacts and short-term recovery of communities, although such investigation can enhance situational awareness during disasters and support the identification of disparate spatial patterns of disaster impacts and recovery in the impacted regions. This study examines credit card transaction data Harris County (Texas, USA) during Hurricane Harvey in 2017 to explore spatial patterns of disaster impacts and recovery during from the perspective of community residents and businesses at ZIP code and county scales, respectively, and to further investigate their spatial disparities across ZIP codes. The results indicate that individuals in ZIP codes with populations of higher income experienced more severe disaster impact and recovered more quickly than those located in lower-income ZIP codes for most business sectors. Our findings not only enhance the understanding of spatial patterns and disparities in disaster impacts and recovery for better community resilience assessment, but also could benefit emergency managers, city planners, and public officials in harnessing population activity data, using credit card transactions as a proxy for activity, to improve situational awareness and resource allocation.

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are able to provide passive beamforming gain via low-cost reflecting elements and hence improve wireless link quality. This work considers two-way passive beamforming design in RIS-aided frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems where the RIS reflection coefficients are the same for downlink and uplink and should be optimized for both directions simultaneously. We formulate a joint optimization of the transmit/receive beamformers at the base station (BS) and the RIS reflection coefficients. The objective is to maximize the weighted sum of the downlink and uplink rates, where the weighting parameter is adjustable to obtain different achievable downlink-uplink rate pairs. We develop an efficient manifold optimization algorithm to obtain a stationary solution. For comparison, we also introduce two heuristic designs based on one-way optimization, namely, time-sharing and phase-averaging. Simulation results show that the proposed manifold-based two-way optimization design significantly enlarges the achievable downlink-uplink rate region compared with the two heuristic designs. It is also shown that phase-averaging is superior to time-sharing when the number of RIS elements is large.

[2101.10096] With Measured Words: Simple Sentence Selection for Black-Box Optimization of Sentence Compression Algorithms	Yotam ShichelBenGurion  KalechBen Gurion  TsurBen Gurion		yotamsh@post.bgu.ac.il orentsur@bgu.ac.il kalech@bgu.ac.il	Sentence Compression is the task of generating a shorter, yet grammatical version of a given sentence, preserving the essence of the original sentence. This paper proposes a Black-Box Optimizer for Compression (B-BOC): given a black-box compression algorithm and assuming not all sentences need be compressed – find the best candidates for compression in order to maximize both compression rate and quality. Given a required compression ratio, we consider two scenarios: (i) single-sentence compression, and (ii) sentences-sequence compression. In the first scenario, our optimizer is trained to predict how well each sentence could be compressed while meeting the specified ratio requirement. In the latter, the desired compression ratio is applied to a sequence of sentences (e.g., a paragraph) as a whole, rather than on each individual sentence. To achieve that, we useB-BOCto assign an optimal compression ratio to each sentence, then cast it as a Knapsack problem, which we solve using bounded dynamic programming. We evaluateB-BOCon both scenarios on three datasets, demonstrating that our optimizer improves both accuracy and Rouge-F1-score compared to direct application of other compression algorithms.

While AOI allows optical investigations at depths, its imaging resolution is inherently limited by the ultrasound wavelength, prohibiting microscopic investigations. Here, we propose a novel computational imaging approach that allows to achieve optical diffraction-limited imaging using a conventional AOI system. We achieve this by extracting diffraction-limited imaging information from ’memory-effect’ speckle-correlations in the conventionally detected ultrasound-modulated scattered-light fields. Specifically, we identify that since speckle correlations allow to estimate the Fourier-magnitude of the field inside the ultrasound focus, scanning the ultrasound focus enables robust diffraction-limited reconstruction of extended objects using ptychography, i.e. we exploit the ultrasound focus as the scanned spatial-gate ‘probe’ required for ptychographic phase-retrieval. Moreover, we exploit the short speckle decorrelation-time in dynamic media, which is usually considered a hurdle for wavefront-shaping based approaches, for improved ptychographic reconstruction. We experimentally demonstrate non-invasive imaging of targets that extend well beyond the memory-effect range, with a 40-times resolution improvement over conventional AOI, surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art approaches.

While steep reflection emissivity profiles can be naturally produced by compact coronae close to black holes, the measured radial emissivity parameter can be further increased by the radial disk ionization profile when the theoretical model assumes a disk with constant ionization. In this paper, we implement the possibility of a radial disk ionization profile in the reflection modelrelxill_nk, which is a package designed to calculate reflection spectra of “deformed” Kerr black holes. We analyze aNuSTARobservation of the black hole binary EXO 1846–031, which was previously found to have a very high inner emissivity index. We find that the model with a radial disk ionization profile improves the fit, but the impact on the estimate of the black hole spin parameter and on the constraint of the deformation parameter is modest. However, we show that the analysis of future observations ofAthenaandeXTPwill necessarily require models with a radial disk ionization profile to have accurate constraints of the deformation parameters.

In order to account for the degeneracy caused by the energy’s invariance under curve reparametrisations, we write the evolving curves as approximate normal graphs over a fixed smooth curve.

Based on black-box model learning with scenario optimisation, we abstract the local behaviour of a DNN via an affine model with the probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee. From the learned model, we can infer the corresponding PAC-model robustness property. The innovation of our work is the integration of model learning into PAC robustness analysis: that is, we construct a PAC guarantee on the model level instead of sample distribution, which induces a more faithful and accurate robustness evaluation. This is in contrast to existing statistical methods without model learning. We implement our method in a prototypical tool namedDeepPAC. As a black-box method,DeepPACis scalable and efficient, especially when DNNs have complex structures or high-dimensional inputs. We extensively evaluateDeepPAC, with 4 baselines (using formal verification, statistical methods, testing and adversarial attack) and 20 DNN models across 3 datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. It is shown thatDeepPACoutperforms the state-of-the-art statistical methodPROVERO, and it achieves more practical robustness analysis than the formal verification toolERAN. Also, its results are consistent with existing DNN testing work likeDeepGini.	neural networks | PAC-model robustness | model learning | scenario optimization

The aim is to investigate the observed change in the well known asymmetric energy of spontaneous fission ofCf as the fragments pass through increasingly thick absorber foils. Two different types of absorbers have been used- one elemental and the outher an organic compound. The stopping powers have been determined as a function of energy for three fragment mass groups with average masses with= 106.5, 141.8, 125.8 corresponding to light, heavy and symmetric fragment ofCf. Using the effective charge (Z) in the stopping power relation in the classical Bohr theory best describes the stopping power data. Spectrum shape parameters, subsequently have been extracted from the energy spectra of fission fragments for different foil thickness. The effective charge (Z) correction term determined from the stopping power data is then used in the simulation for the absorber thickness dependence of the shape parameters of the energy spectrum. The present simulation results are compared with the TRIM prediction. The trends of the absorber thickness dependence of the spectrum shape parameters, for both Mylar and Aluminium are well reproduced with the present simulation.

The centre of mass energy of the collisions is equal to the rest mass of theresonance of. A high vertex resolution is essential for measuring the decay vertices of B mesons. Typical momenta of the decay products are ranging from a few tens ofto a fewand multiple scattering has a significant impact on the vertex resolution. The VerteX Detector (VXD) for Belle II is therefore designed to have as little material as possible inside the acceptance region. Especially the innermost two layers, populated by the PiXel Detector (PXD), have to be ultra-thin. The PXD is based onDEpleted P-channel Field Effect Transistors(DEPFETs) with a thickness of only. Spatial resolution and hit efficiency of production detector modules were studied in beam tests performed at the DESY test beam facility. The spatial resolution was investigated as a function of the incidence angle and improvements due to charge sharing are demonstrated.

Firstly, we discuss the non-extended phase space thermodynamics of regular black holes. We obtain expressions for various thermodynamic quantities like temperature, entropy, internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, pressure, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy. Then we introduce quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of Bardeen type (toy model) of regular black holes. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of these corrections is carried by plotting all the corrected thermodynamic quantities. The comparative analysis is then done where the effects of these corrections can be clearly seen.	Bardeen regualr black holes | quantum corrections | stability | entropy.

Thereby, Faraday’s law is introduced as a consequence of the relativity principle rather than an experimental fact, in contrast to the historical course and common textbook presentations. As a by-product, this procedure yields explicit expressions for the infinitesimal Lorentz and, upon integration, the finite Lorentz transformation. The proposed approach helps to elucidate the relation between Galilei and Lorentz transformations and provides an alternative derivation of the Lorentz transformation without explicitly referring to the speed of light.

During the administration of President Donald Trump, charges of “fake news” made social and news media not only the means but, to an unprecedented extent, the topic of political communication. Using data from before the November 3rd, 2020 US Presidential election, recent work has demonstrated the viability of using YouTube’s social media ecosystem to obtain insights into the extent of US political polarization as well as the relationship between this polarization and the nature of the content and commentary provided by different US news networks. With that work as background, this paper looks at the sharp transformation of the relationship between news consumers and here-to-fore “fringe” news media channels in the 64 days between the US presidential election and the violence that took place at US Capitol on January 6. This paper makes two distinct types of contributions. The first is to introduce a novel methodology to analyze large social media data to study the dynamics of social political news networks and their viewers. The second is to provide insights into what actually happened regarding US political social media channels and their viewerships during this volatile 64 day period.

Due to the nature of these systems, coordination among agents via communication is frequently necessary. Indeed, Perception-Action-Communication (PAC) loops, or Perception-Action loops closed over a communication channel, are a critical component of multi-robot systems. However, we lack appropriate tools for simulating PAC loops. To that end, in this paper, we introduceROS-NetSim, a ROS package that acts as an interface between robotic and network simulators. With ROS-NetSim, we can attain high-fidelity representations of both robotic and network interactions by accurately simulating the PAC loop. Our proposed approach is lightweight, modular and adaptive. Furthermore, it can be used with many available network and physics simulators by making use of our proposed interface. In summary, ROS-NetSim is (i) Transparent to the ROS target application, (ii) Agnostic to the specific network and physics simulator being used, and (iii) Tunable in fidelity and complexity. As part of our contribution, we have made available an open-source implementation of ROS-NetSim to the community.

Our objective is both to improve the results obtained by other methods that try to select the best aggregation function for a particular set of data, such as penalty functions, and to reduce the temporal complexity required by such approaches. We discuss how this notion can be defined and present three illustrative examples of the applicability of our new proposal in areas where temporal constraints can be strict, such as image processing, deep learning and decision making, obtaining favourable results in the process.

In this paper, we study an extension of the theorem to the static black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Horndeski theories. We study the black hole interior geometry for some exact solutions and find that the spacetime has a (space-like) curvature singularity where the black hole mass gets an extremum and the Hawking temperature vanishes. We discuss further extensions of the theorem, including general Horndeski theories from disformal transformations.	No hair theorem | Cauchy horizon | Black hole singularity | Horndeski theory

Via defensive deception, the defender can anticipate attacker actions; it can mislead or lure attacker, or hide real resources. Although defensive deception is increasingly popular in the research community, there has not been a systematic investigation of its key components, the underlying principles, and its tradeoffs in various problem settings. This survey paper focuses on defensive deception research centered on game theory and machine learning, since these are prominent families of artificial intelligence approaches that are widely employed in defensive deception. This paper brings forth insights, lessons, and limitations from prior work. It closes with an outline of some research directions to tackle major gaps in current defensive deception research.

We propose a general framework to generate sparse, in-distribution counterfactual model explanations which match a desired target prediction with a conditional generative model, allowing batches of counterfactual instances to be generated with a single forward pass. The method is flexible with respect to the type of generative model used as well as the task of the underlying predictive model. This allows straightforward application of the framework to different modalities such as images, time series or tabular data as well as generative model paradigms such as GANs or autoencoders and predictive tasks like classification or regression. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on image (CelebA), time series (ECG) and mixed-type tabular (Adult Census) data.

Javaraiah11affiliationmark:	affiliationmark:	20jdotjavaraiah@gmail.com jajj55@yahoo.co.in jdotjavaraiah@gmail.com	There exists a small but statistically significant north–south asymmetry in most of the solar activity indices and it has important implications on the solar dynamo mechanism. Here we analyzed the daily sunspot-group data reported by the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) during the period 1874 – 1976, Debrecen Photoheligraphic Data (DPD) during the period 1977 – 2017, and the revised Version-2 of international sunspot number (ISSN) during the period 1874 – 2017. We determined the amplitudes (the largest 13-month smoothed monthly ISSN) of Solar Cycles 12 – 24 and the 13-month smoothed monthly mean corrected areas of the sunspot groups in the Sun’s whole-sphere (WSGA), northern hemisphere (NSGA), and southern hemisphere (SSGA) at the epochs of the maxima of Solar Cycles 12 – 24. Using all these we obtained the relations similar to that found in our earlier analyzes–the existence of a high correlation between the sum of the areas of sunspot groups in the southern-hemisphere near-equatorial band during a small (7–9 months) interval just after a maximum epoch of a solar cycle and the amplitude of next solar cycle–separately for the Sun’s whole-sphere and northern- and southern-hemispheres. By using these relations we predict701 msh (millionth of solar hemisphere),429 msh, and366 msh for the values of WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA, respectively, at the maximum epoch of Solar Cycle 25. We predictfor the amplitude of Solar Cycle 25. The 13-month smoothed monthly mean sunspot-group area highly correlate with that of ISSN. Using this relation and the predicted values of WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA we obtainfor the amplitude of Solar Cycle 25, which is slightly lower than the aforementioned predicted value, andandfor the values of northern- and southern-hemispheres’ sunspot numbers at the maximum epoch of Solar Cycle 25. The difference between the predicted NSGA and SSGA and also that between northern- and southern-hemispheres’ sunspot numbers at the maximum epoch of Cycle 25 are considerably small. Overall, our results suggest that the amplitude of Cycle 25 would be 25 %–40 % smaller, and the corresponding north–south asymmetry would be much smaller, than those of Cycle 24.	Keywords

The confidentiality of keys distributed with the use of QKD protocols is guaranteed by the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. This paper is devoted to the decoy state method, a countermeasure against vulnerabilities caused by the use of coherent states of light for QKD protocols whose security is proved under the assumption of single-photon states. We give a formal security proof of the decoy state method against all possible attacks. We compare two widely known attacks on multiphoton pulses: photon-number splitting and beam splitting. Finally, we discuss the equivalence of polarization and phase coding.

We propose a novel interaction between local spins considering microscopic interactions between an optical vortex and electrons. This vortex-induced interaction modulates the chiral magnetic order in an entirely different way than an external magnetic field does. Our spin modulation technique may pave a route to create a unique topological or chiral structure for future opto-spintronics devices.	chiral helimagnet | optical vortex | spintronics

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and World Health Organization report that one in three adults over the age of 65 and half of the adults over 80 fall each year. In recent years, an ever-increasing range of applications have been developed to help deliver more effective falls prevention interventions. All these applications rely on a huge elderly personal database collected from hospitals, mutual health, and other organizations in caring for elderly. The information describing an elderly is continually evolving and may become obsolete at a given moment and contradict what we already know on the same person. So, it needs to be continuously checked and updated in order to restore the database consistency and then provide better service. This paper provides an outline of an Obsolete personal Information Update System (OIUS) designed in the context of the elderly-fall prevention project. Our OIUS aims to control and update in real-time the information acquired about each older adult, provide on-demand consistent information and supply tailored interventions to caregivers and fall-risk patients. The approach outlined for this purpose is based on a polynomial-time algorithm build on top of a causal Bayesian network representing the elderly data. The result is given as a recommendation tree with some accuracy level. We conduct a thorough empirical study for such a model on an elderly personal information base. Experiments confirm the viability and effectiveness of our OIUS.	obsolete information | information update | Bayesian Networks | falls | older adults | recommender system | real medical study

We carry out a recurrence plot based analysis for different paradigmatic systems and nonlinear empirical data in order to demonstrate the ability of our method to detect dynamical transitions ranging across different temporal scales. It succeeds to distinguish states of varying dynamical complexity in the presence of noise and non-stationarity, even when the time series is of short length. In contrast to traditional recurrence quantifiers, no specification of minimal line lengths is required and rather geometric features beyond linear structures in the recurrence plot can be accounted for. This makes lacunarity more broadly applicable as a recurrence quantification measure. Lacunarity is usually interpreted as a measure of heterogeneity or translational invariance of an arbitrary spatial pattern. In application to recurrence plots, it quantifies the degree of heterogenity in the temporal recurrence patterns at all relevant time scales. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed method when applied to empirical data, namely time series of acoustic pressure fluctuations from a turbulent combustor. Recurrence lacunarity captures both the rich variability in dynamical complexity of acoustic pressure fluctuations and shifting time scales encoded in the recurrence plots. Furthermore, it contributes to a better distinction between stable operation and near blowout states of combustors.

Based on this observation, we introduce amodified Kačanov method, which allows for (adaptive) damping, and, thereby, to derive a new convergence analysis under more general assumptions and for a wider range of applications. For instance, in the specific context of quasilinear diffusion models, our new approach does no longer require a standard monotonicity condition on the nonlinear diffusion coefficient to hold. Moreover, we propose two different adaptive strategies for the practical selection of the damping parameters involved.

[2101.10138] Plasma steering to avoid disruptions in ITER and tokamak power plants	Allen H Boozer	Columbia University New York NY 10027 	ahb17@columbia.edu	Steering tokamak plasmas is commonly viewed as a way to avoid disruptions and runaway electrons. Plasma steering sounds as safe as driving to work but will be shown to more closely resemble driving at high speed through a dense fog on an icy road. The long time required to terminate an ITER discharge compared to time over which dangers can be foreseen is analogous to driving in a dense fog. The difficulty of regaining plasma control if it is lost resembles driving on an icy road. Disruptions and runaways are associated with three issues—a solution to one tends to complicate the solution to the other two: loss of plasma position control, excessive heat deposition, and wall melting due to runaway electrons. All three risks must be addressed for ITER to achieve its mission and essentially eliminated before tokamak power plants can be deployed.

[2101.10143] Spectral Leakage and Rethinking the Kernel Size in CNNs	Nergis Tomen, Jan C. van GemertComputer Vision Lab, Delft University of TechnologyDelft, 2628CD,			Convolutional layers in CNNs implement linear filters which decompose the input into different frequency bands. However, most modern architectures neglect standard principles of filter design when optimizing their model choices regarding the size and shape of the convolutional kernel. In this work, we consider the well-known problem of spectral leakage caused by windowing artifacts in filtering operations in the context of CNNs. We show that the small size of CNN kernels make them susceptible to spectral leakage, which may induce performance-degrading artifacts. To address this issue, we propose the use of larger kernel sizes along with the Hamming window function to alleviate leakage in CNN architectures. We demonstrate improved classification accuracy on multiple benchmark datasets including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with the simple use of a standard window function in convolutional layers. Finally, we show that CNNs employing the Hamming window display increased robustness against various adversarial attacks. Code is available111Code will be made available at github..	
[2101.10144] Sub-Quantum Fisher Information	M. Cerezo Akira Sone Jacob L. Beckey Patrick J. Coles	thanks:		The Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) plays a crucial role in quantum information theory and in many practical applications such as quantum metrology. However, computing the QFI is generally a computationally demanding task. In this work we analyze a lower bound on the QFI which we call the sub-Quantum Fisher Information (sub-QFI). The bound can be efficiently estimated on a quantum computer for an-qubit state usingqubits. The sub-QFI is based on the super-fidelity, an upper bound on Uhlmann’s fidelity. We analyze the sub-QFI in the context of unitary families, where we derive several crucial properties including its geometrical interpretation. In particular, we prove that the QFI and the sub-QFI are maximized for the same optimal state, which implies that the sub-QFI is faithful to the QFI in the sense that both quantities share the same global extrema. Based on this faithfulness, the sub-QFI acts as an efficiently computable surrogate for the QFI for quantum sensing and quantum metrology applications. Finally, we provide additional meaning to the sub-QFI as a measure of coherence, asymmetry, and purity loss.	
[2101.10145] Codes approaching the Shannon limit with polynomial complexity per information bit	Ilya Dumer and Navid GharaviUniversity of California, Riverside, USAEmail:		navid.gharavi@email.ucr.edu dumer@ee.ucr.edu	We consider codes for channels with extreme noise that emerge in various low-power applications. Simple LDPC-type codes with parity checks of weight 3 are first studied for any dimensionThese codes form modulation schemes: they improve the original channel output for anydB (per information bit) and gaindB over uncoded modulation asgrows. However, they also have a floor on the output bit error rate (BER) irrespective of their length. Tight lower and upper bounds, which are virtually identical to simulation results, are then obtained for BER at any SNR. We also study a combined scheme that splitsinformation bits intoblocks and protects each with some polar code. Decoding moves back and forth between polar and LDPC codes, every time using a polar code of a higher rate. For a sufficiently large constantand, this design yields a vanishing BER at any SNR that is arbitrarily close to the Shannon limit of -1.59 dB. Unlike other existing designs, this scheme has polynomial complexity of orderper information bit.

The polymer completely dissociates when it is saturated with water, releasing small cations while anions remain bound to the polymer chains. When this strip is subject to an orthogonal electric field, the cations migrate towards the negative electrode, carrying water away by osmosis. This leads to the bending of the strip. We have previously published a modelling of this system based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes. In this paper, we use this model to simulate numerically the bending of a strip. Since the amplitude of the deflection is large, we use a beam model in large displacements. In addition, the material permittivity may increase with ion concentration. We therefore test three permittivity models. We plot the profiles of the cations concentration, pressure, electric potential and induction, and we study the influence of the strip geometry on the tip displacement and on the blocking force. The results we obtain are in good agreement with the experimental data published in the literature. The variation of these quantities with the imposed electric potential allow us to discriminate between the three models.	Keywords

Different from existing models for sentiment-topic extraction which assume topics are grouped under discrete sentiment categories such as ‘positive’, ‘negative’ and ‘neural’, BTM is able to automatically infer real-valued brand-associated sentiment scores and generate fine-grained sentiment-topics in which we can observe continuous changes of words under a certain topic (e.g., ‘shaver’ or ‘cream’) while its associated sentiment gradually varies from negative to positive. BTM is built on the Poisson factorisation model with the incorporation of adversarial learning. It has been evaluated on a dataset constructed from Amazon reviews. Experimental results show that BTM outperforms a number of competitive baselines in brand ranking, achieving a better balance of topic coherence and uniqueness, and extracting better-separated polarity-bearing topics.

This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Award 1809830 and 1932501.	guo-ye@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn	The problem of pricing utility-scale energy storage resources (ESRs) in the real-time electricity market is considered. Under a rolling-window dispatch model where the operator centrally dispatches generation and consumption under forecasting uncertainty, it is shown that almost all uniform pricing schemes, including the standard locational marginal pricing (LMP), result in lost opportunity costs that require out-of-the-market settlements. It is also shown that such settlements give rise to disincentives for generating firms and storage participants to bid truthfully, even when these market participants are rational price-takers in a competitive market. Temporal locational marginal pricing (TLMP) is proposed for ESRs as a generalization of LMP to an in-market discriminative form. TLMP is a sum of the system-wide energy price, LMP, and the individual state-of-charge price. It is shown that, under arbitrary forecasting errors, the rolling-window implementation of TLMP eliminates the lost opportunity costs and provides incentives to price-taking firms to bid truthfully with their marginal costs. Numerical examples show insights into the effects of uniform and non-uniform pricing mechanisms on dispatch following and truthful bidding incentives.

[2101.10152] ROOSTER: a machine-learning analysis tool for Kepler stellar rotation periods	S.N. Breton A.R.G. Santos L. Bugnet S. Mathur R.A García P.L. Pallé	institutetext:	sylvain.breton@cea.fr	In order to understand stellar evolution, it is crucial to efficiently determine stellar surface rotation periods. Indeed, while they are of greatest importance in stellar models, angular momentum transport processes inside stars are still poorly understood today. Surface rotation, linked to the age of the star, is one of the constraints needed to improve the way those processes are modelled. Statistics of the surface rotation periods for a large sample of stars of different spectral types are thus necessary. An efficient tool to automatically determine reliable rotation periods is needed when dealing with large samples of stellar photometric datasets. The objective of this work is to develop such a tool. For this purpose, machine learning classifiers represent relevant bricks for the basis of our new methodology. Random forest learning abilities are exploited to automate the extraction of rotation periods inKeplerlight curves. Rotation periods and complementary parameters are obtained from three different methods: a wavelet analysis, the autocorrelation function of the light curve, and the composite spectrum. We train three different classifiers: one to detect if rotational modulations are present in the light curve, one to flag close binary or classical pulsators candidates that can bias our rotation period determination, and finally one classifier to provide the final rotation period. We test our machine learning pipeline on 23,431 stars of theKeplerK and M dwarf reference rotation catalog ofSantos et al. (2019)for which 60% of the stars have been visually inspected. For the sample of 21,707 stars where all the input parameters are provided to the algorithm, 94.2% of them are correctly classified (as rotating or not). Among the stars that have a rotation period in the reference catalog, the machine learning provides a period that agrees within 10% of the reference value for 95.3% of the stars. Moreover, the yield of correct rotation periods is raised to 99.5% after visually inspecting 25.2% of the stars. Over the two main analysis steps, rotation classification and period selection, the pipeline yields a global agreement with the reference values of 92.1% and 96.9% before and after visual inspection. Random forest classifiers are efficient tools to determine reliable rotation periods in large samples of stars. The methodology presented here could be easily adapted to extract surface rotation periods for stars with different spectral types or observed by other instruments such as K2, TESS or, in a near future, PLATO.

Melko Juan Carrasquilla	Institute MaRS Centre Toronto Ontario M5G 1M1 CanadaDepartment of Physics and Astronomy University of Waterloo Ontario N2L 3G1 Canada	mohamed.hibat.allah@uwaterloo.ca	Many important challenges in science and technology can be cast as optimization problems. When viewed in a statistical physics framework, these can be tackled by simulated annealing, where a gradual cooling procedure helps search for groundstate solutions of a target Hamiltonian. While powerful, simulated annealing is known to have prohibitively slow sampling dynamics when the optimization landscape is rough or glassy. Here we show that by generalizing the target distribution with a parameterized model, an analogous annealing framework based on the variational principle can be used to search for groundstate solutions. Modern autoregressive models such as recurrent neural networks provide ideal parameterizations since they can be exactly sampled without slow dynamics even when the model encodes a rough landscape. We implement this procedure in the classical and quantum settings on several prototypical spin glass Hamiltonians, and find that it significantly outperforms traditional simulated annealing in the asymptotic limit, illustrating the potential power of this yet unexplored route to optimization.

[2101.10156] Mask-based Data Augmentation for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation				Semantic segmentation using convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a crucial component in image analysis. Training a CNN to perform semantic segmentation requires a large amount of labeled data, where the production of such labeled data is both costly and labor intensive. Semi-supervised learning algorithms address this issue by utilizing unlabeled data and so reduce the amount of labeled data needed for training. In particular, data augmentation techniques such as CutMix and ClassMix generate additional training data from existing labeled data. In this paper we propose a new approach for data augmentation, termed ComplexMix, which incorporates aspects of CutMix and ClassMix with improved performance. The proposed approach has the ability to control the complexity of the augmented data while attempting to be semantically-correct and address the tradeoff between complexity and correctness. The proposed ComplexMix approach is evaluated on a standard dataset for semantic segmentation and compared to other state-of-the-art techniques. Experimental results show that our method yields improvement over state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets for semantic image segmentation.	
[2101.10157] Performance of Cell-Free MmWave Massive MIMO Systems with Fronthaul Compression and DAC Quantization	In-soo Kim and Junil Choi	School of Electrical EngineeringKAISTDaejeon KoreaE-mail: {insookim 		In this paper, the zero-forcing (ZF) precoder with max-min power allocation is proposed for cell-free millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) with limited-capacity fronthaul links. The proposed power allocation aims to achieve max-min fairness on the achievable rate lower bounds of the users obtained by the additive quantization noise model (AQNM), which mimics the effect of low-resolution DACs. To solve the max-min power allocation problem, an alternating optimization (AO) method is proposed, which is guaranteed to converge because the global optima of the subproblems that constitute the original problem are attained at each AO iteration. The performance of cell-free and small-cell systems is explored in the simulation results, which suggest that not-too-small fronthaul capacity suffices for cell-free systems to outperform small-cell systems.

To account for the propagation delay across the antenna array, which cannot be neglected in wideband mmWave massive MIMO systems, the discrete time channel that models the spatial wideband effect is developed. Also, the training signal design that addresses inter-frame, inter-user, and inter-symbol interferences is investigated when the spatial wideband effect is not negligible. To estimate the channel parameters over the continuum based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion, the Newtonized fully corrective forward greedy selection-cross validation-based (NFCFGS-CV-based) channel estimator is proposed. NFCFGS-CV is a gridless compressed sensing (CS) algorithm, whose termination condition is determined by the CV technique. The CV-based termination condition is proved to achieve the minimum squared error (SE). The simulation results show that NFCFGS-CV outperforms state-of-the-art on-grid CS-based channel estimators.

[2101.10160] Measuring Dependence with Matrix-based Entropy Functional	Shujian Yu1, Francesco Alesiani1, Xi Yu2, Robert Jenssen3, José C. Príncipe2			Measuring the dependence of data plays a central role in statistics and machine learning. In this work, we summarize and generalize the main idea of existing information-theoretic dependence measures into a higher-level perspective by the Shearer’s inequality. Based on our generalization, we then propose two measures, namely the matrix-based normalized total correlation () and the matrix-based normalized dual total correlation (), to quantify the dependence of multiple variables in arbitrary dimensional space, without explicit estimation of the underlying data distributions. We show that our measures are differentiable and statistically more powerful than prevalent ones. We also show the impact of our measures in four different machine learning problems, namely the gene regulatory network inference, the robust machine learning under covariate shift and non-Gaussian noises, the subspace outlier detection, and the understanding of the learning dynamics of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to demonstrate their utilities, advantages, as well as implications to those problems. Code of our dependence measure is available at:https://bit.ly/AAAI-dependence.

[2101.10162] Solving a Multi-resource Partial-ordering Flexible Variant of the Job-shop Scheduling Problem with Hybrid ASP	Giulia Francescutto Konstantin Schekotihin Mohammed M. S. El-Kholany	institutetext:	giulia.francescutto@infineon.com	Many complex activities of production cycles, such as quality control or fault analysis, require highly experienced specialists to perform various operations on (semi)finished products using different tools. In practical scenarios, the selection of a next operation is complicated, since each expert has only a local view on the total set of operations to be performed. As a result, decisions made by the specialists are suboptimal and might cause significant costs. In this paper, we consider aMulti-resource Partial-ordering Flexible Job-shop Scheduling(MPF-JSS) problem where partially-ordered sequences of operations must be scheduled on multiple required resources, such as tools and specialists. The resources are flexible and can perform one or more operations depending on their properties. The problem is modeled using Answer Set Programming (ASP) in which the time assignments are efficiently done using Difference Logic. Moreover, we suggest two multi-shot solving strategies aiming at the identification of the time bounds allowing for a solution of the schedule optimization problem. Experiments conducted on a set of instances extracted from a medium-sized semiconductor fault analysis lab indicate that our approach can find schedules for 87 out of 91 considered real-world instances.

Email: School of Engineering Science Osaka University Osaka Japan.National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) Tsukuba Japan.	wan@sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp	Purpose of this paper:This paper presents a hierarchical motion planner for planning the manipulation motion to repose long and heavy objects considering external support surfaces.Design/methodology/approach:The planner includes a task level layer and a motion level layer. We formulate the manipulation planning problem at the task level by considering grasp poses as nodes and object poses for edges. We consider regrasping and constrained in-hand slip (drooping) during building graphs and find mixed regrasping and drooping sequences by searching the graph. The generated sequences autonomously divide the object weight between the arm and the support surface and avoid configuration obstacles. Cartesian planning is used at the robot motion level to generate motions between adjacent critical grasp poses of the sequence found by the task level layer.Findings:Various experiments are carried out to examine the performance of the proposed planner. The results show improved capability of robot arms to manipulate long and heavy objects using the proposed planner.What is original/value of paper:Our contribution is we initially develop a graph-based planning system that reasons both in-hand and regrasp manipulation motion considering external supports. On one hand, the planner integrates regrasping and drooping to realize in-hand manipulation with external support. On the other hand, it switches states by releasing and regrasping objects when the object is in stably placed. The search graphs’ nodes could be retrieved from remote cloud servers that provide a large amount of pre-annotated data to implement cyber intelligence.

Previous research has shown how linguistic accommodation correlates with gaps in the power and status of the speakers and the way it promotes approval and discussion efficiency. In this work, we provide a novel perspective on the phenomena, exploring its correlation with the open-mindedness of a speaker, rather than to her social status. We process thousands of unstructured argumentative discussions that took place in Reddit’s Change My View (CMV) subreddit, demonstrating that open-mindedness relates to the assumed role of a speaker in different contexts. On the discussion level, we surprisingly find that discussions that reach agreement present lower levels of accommodation.

This Hamiltonian admits a compact matrix-product-operator representation and can be efficiently and accurately solved using the density-matrix renormalization group. We systematically explore the effects of the charging energy. Forcomparable to the superconducting gap, the subgap states are stabilized by the combination of Kondo exchange coupling and charge redistribution driven by the Coulomb interaction. The subgap states exist for both even and odd superconductor ground-state occupancy, but with very distinctive excitation spectra in each case. The spectral peaks are not symmetric with respect to the chemical potential and may undergo discontinuous changes as a function of gate voltages.

[2101.10170] Kerr-Nonlinearity-Induced Mode-Splitting in Optical Microresonators	George N. Ghalanos Jonathan M. Silver Leonardo Del Bino Niall Moroney Shuangyou Zhang Michael T. M. Woodley Andreas Ø. Svela Pascal Del’Haye	Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light Staudtstraße 2 91058 Erlangen GermanyNational Physical Laboratory Hampton Road Teddington TW11 0LW UKBlackett Laboratory Imperial College London SW7 2AZ UK		The Kerr effect in optical microresonators plays an important role for integrated photonic devices and enables third harmonic generation, four-wave mixing, and the generation of microresonator-based frequency combs. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the Kerr nonlinearity can split ultra-high-Q microresonator resonances for two continuous-wave lasers. The resonance splitting is induced by self- and cross-phase modulation and counter-intuitively enables two lasers at different wavelengths to be simultaneously resonant in the same microresonator mode. We develop a pump-probe spectroscopy scheme that allows us to measure power dependent resonance splittings of up to 35 cavity linewidths (corresponding to 52 MHz) at 10 mW of pump power. The required power to split the resonance by one cavity linewidth is only. In addition, we demonstrate threefold resonance splitting when taking into account four-wave mixing and two counterpropagating probe lasers. These Kerr splittings are of interest for applications that require two resonances at optically controlled offsets, eg. for opto-mechanical coupling to phonon modes, optical memories, and precisely adjustable spectral filters.

[2101.10174] Dry and Moist Atmospheric Circulation with Uniform Sea-Surface Temperature	D.L. Suhas Jai Sukhatme Nili Harnik	Corresponding author: D.L. Suhas for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Indian Institute of Science Bangalore 560012 India	suhasdl.mysore@gmail.com	The steady and transient response of ”dynamically” dry and moist atmospheres to uniform sea-surface temperature (SST) is studied. Specifically, the latent heat () of water vapor is varied, so that for small, water substance is essentially a passive tracer from a dynamical point of view. Despite the lack of SST gradients, a general circulation with Hadley and Ferrel cells is observed for relatively stronger moist coupling. Organized precipitation patterns via equatorial waves appear to play a significant role in tropical ascent, and along with the equatorial deformation radius, the Hadley cell width increases with coupling strength. An abrupt switch to a much shallower tropical cell is noted when the system becomes completely passive. In all cases, the Hadley cell is thermally indirect and is influenced by eddy fluxes which are strong in the upper and lower troposphere. Moist static energy is transported equatorward in the tropics and a larger amount is directed poleward in the midlatitudes. As a whole, there is an almost invariant poleward transport of moist static energy for relatively strong coupling of water substance. Transient extratropical activity is seen in the form of intense warm-core vortices for strong coupling, and these systems become weaker and smaller asdecreases. The drift of these moist vortices results in the observed poleward energy transport in the midlatitudes. In the tropics, intraseasonal variability is dominant and systematically shifts to longer time periods with stronger coupling. In fact, large-scale, low-frequency Kelvin waves and MJO-like modes disappear as water vapor becomes passive in nature. Finally, extreme rainfall events associated with cyclonic storms vanish as water vapor becomes dynamically inactive, however, moderate precipitation events increase leading to higher total precipitation for weaker coupling of water substance. Tropospheric heating due to a saturation of the outgoing longwave radiation results in an increase in the stability of the atmosphere for strong coupling, and provides a plausible physical mechanism for interpreting the behavior of precipitation.

We define Relative Canonical Network ensembles as the ensembles that realize a property R while being as indistinguishable as possible from a generic network ensemble. This allows us to study the most generic features of the networks giving rise to the property under investigation. To test the approach we apply it first to the network measure ”small-world-ness”, thought to characterize small-world networks. We find several phase transitions as we go to less and less generic networks in which cliques and hubs emerge. Such features are not shared by typical small-world networks, showing that high ”small-world-ness” does not characterize small-world networks as they are commonly understood. On the other hand we see that for embedded networks, the average shortest path length and total Euclidean link length are better at characterizing small-world networks, with hubs that emerge as a defining feature at low genericity. We expect the overall approach to have wide applicability for understanding network properties of real world interest.	MCMC | Complex Networks | Small-world

We show that two properties are necessary and sufficient. These properties are consequences of that, in a number, it is not an advantage to be the first player. One of these properties implies the other. However, checking for one or the other, rather than just one, can often be accomplished by only looking at the positions on the ‘board’. If the stronger property holds for all positions, then the values are integers.	Keywords

By understanding how these representational structures work, we not only understand more about human cognition but also gain a better understanding for how humans rationalise and explain decisions. This has an influencing effect on explainable AI, where the goal is to provide explanations of computer decision-making for a human audience. We show that the Contextual Importance and Utility method for XAI share an overlap with the current new wave of action-oriented predictive representational structures, in ways that makes CIU a reliable tool for creating explanations that humans can relate to and trust.	
[2101.10180] Finite gyro-radius multidimensional electron hole equilibria	I H Hutchinson	Science and Fusion CenterMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyCambridge MA 02139 USA	ihutch@mit.edu	Finite electron gyro-radius influences on the trapping and charge density distribution of electron holes of limited transverse extent are calculated analytically and explored by numerical orbit integration in low to moderate magnetic fields. Parallel trapping is shown to depend upon the gyro-averaged potential energy and to give rise to gyro-averaged charge deficit. Both types of average are expressible as convolutions with perpendicular Gaussians of width equal to the thermal gyro-radius. Orbit-following confirms these phenomena but also confirms for the first time in self-consistent potential profiles the importance of gyro-bounce-resonance detrapping and consequent velocity diffusion on stochastic orbits. The averaging strongly reduces the trapped electron deficit that can be sustained by any potential profile whose transverse width is comparable to the gyro-radius. It effectively prevents equilibrium widths smaller thanfor times longer than a quarter parallel-bounce-period. Avoiding gyro-bounce resonance detrapping is even more restrictive, except for very small potential amplitudes, but it takes multiple bounce-periods to act. Quantitative criteria are given for both types of orbit loss.

However, the presence of rogue IoT devices has exposed the IoT to untold risks with severe consequences. The first step in securing the IoT is detecting rogue IoT devices and identifying legitimate ones.Conventional approaches use cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate and verify legitimate devices’ identities. However, cryptographic protocols are not available in many systems. Meanwhile, these methods are less effective when legitimate devices can be exploited or encryption keys are disclosed.Therefore, non-cryptographic IoT device identification and rogue device detection become efficient solutions to secure existing systems and will provide additional protection to systems with cryptographic protocols. Non-cryptographic approaches require more effort and are not yet adequately investigated. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey onmachine learning technologies for the identification of IoT devices along with the detection of compromised or falsified ones from the viewpoint of passive surveillance agents or network operators.We classify the IoT device identification and detection into four categories: device-specific pattern recognition, Deep Learning enabled device identification, unsupervised device identification, and abnormal device detection. Meanwhile, we discuss various ML-related enabling technologies for this purpose.These enabling technologies include learning algorithms, feature engineering on network traffic traces and wireless signals, continual learning, and abnormality detection.

An important question is whether the odd-even effect in solar-metallicity stars is similar to the Sun, or if there are variations that can tell us about different chemical enrichment histories. In this work, we report for the first time observational evidence of a differential odd-even effect in the solar twin HIP 11915, relative to the solar odd-even abundance pattern. The spectra of this star were obtained with high resolving power (140 000) and signal-to-noise ratio (420) using the ESPRESSO spectrograph and the VLT telescope. Thanks to the high spectral quality, we obtained extremely precise stellar parameters (= 2 K,= 0.003 dex, and= 0.008 dex). We determine the chemical abundance of 20 elements () with high precision (0.01 dex), which shows a strong pattern of the odd-even effect even after performing Galactic Chemical Evolution corrections. The odd-even effect is reasonably well-reproduced by a core-collapse supernova of 13and metallicity Z = 0.001 diluted into a metal-poor gas of 1. Our results indicate that HIP 11915 has an odd-even effect slightly different than the Sun, thus confirming a different supernova enrichment history.	stars: solar-type – stars: abundances – stars: atmospheres – stars: fundamental parameters – techniques: spectroscopic
[2101.10183] Modeling and simulation of vascular tumors embedded in evolving capillary networks	Marvin Fritz, Prashant K. Jha, Tobias Köppl, J. Tinsley Oden,Andreas Wagner, and Barbara Wohlmuth			In this work, we present a coupled 3D-1D model of solid tumor growth within a dynamically changing vascular network to facilitate realistic simulations of angiogenesis. Additionally, the model includes erosion of the extracellular matrix, interstitial flow, and coupled flow in blood vessels and tissue. We employ continuum mixture theory with stochastic Cahn–Hilliard type phase-field models of tumor growth. The interstitial flow is governed by a mesoscale version of Darcy’s law. The flow in the blood vessels is controlled by Poiseuille flow, and Starling’s law is applied to model the mass transfer in and out of blood vessels. The evolution of the network of blood vessels is orchestrated by the concentration of the tumor angiogenesis factors (TAFs); blood vessels grow towards the increasing TAFs concentrations. This process is not deterministic, allowing random growth of blood vessels and, therefore, due to the coupling of nutrients in tissue and vessels, makes the growth of tumors stochastic. We demonstrate the performance of the model by applying it to a variety of scenarios. Numerical experiments illustrate the flexibility of the model and its ability to generate satellite tumors. Simulations of the effects of angiogenesis on tumor growth are presented as well as sample-independent features of cancer.

Pereira is with Department of Electrical Engineering Chalmers University of Technology Gothenburg Sweden Email:	lipgyorgy@scl.sztaki.hu	In this paper a novel non-negative finite volume discretization scheme is proposed for certain first order nonlinear partial differential equations describing conservation laws arising in traffic flow modelling. The spatially discretized model is shown to preserve several fundamentally important analytical properties of the conservation law (e.g., conservativeness, capacity) giving rise to a set of (second order) polynomial ODEs. Furthermore, it is shown that the discretized traffic flow model is formally kinetic and that it can be interpreted in a compartmental context. As a consequence, traffic networks can be represented as reaction graphs. It is shown that the model can be equipped with on- and off- ramps in a physically meaningful way, still preserving the advantageous properties of the discretization. Numerical case studies include empirical convergence tests, and the stability analysis presented in the paper paves the way to scalable observer and controller design.

[2101.10192] Long-range spin-wave propagation in transversely magnetized nano-scaled conduits	Björn Heinz Qi Wang Michael Schneider Elisabeth Weiß Akira Lentfert Bert Lägel Thomas Brächer Carsten Dubs Oleksandr V. Dobrovolskiy Philipp Pirro Andrii V. Chumak	Physik and Landesforschungszentrum OPTIMAS Technische Universität Kaiserslautern D-67663 Kaiserslautern Germany	bheinz@rhrk.uni-kl.de ppirro@rhrk.uni-kl.de andrii.chumak@univie.ac.at	Magnonics attracts increasing attention in the view of novel low-energy computation technologies based on spin waves. Recently, spin-wave propagation in longitudinally magnetized nano-scaled spin-wave conduits was demonstrated, proving the fundamental feasibility of magnonics at the sub-scale. Transversely magnetized nano-conduits, which are of great interest in this regard as they offer a large group velocity and a potentially chirality-based protected transport of energy, have not yet been investigated due to their complex internal magnetic field distribution. Here, we present a study of propagating spin waves in a transversely magnetized nanoscopic yttrium iron garnet conduit ofwidth. Space and time-resolved micro-focused Brillouin-light-scattering spectroscopy is employed to measure the spin-wave group velocity and decay length. A long-range spin-wave propagation is observed with a decay length of up toand a large spin-wave lifetime of up to. The results are supported with micro-magnetic simulations, revealing a single-mode dispersion relation in contrast to the common formation of localized edge modes for microscopic systems. Furthermore, a frequency non-reciprocity for counter-propagating spin waves is observed in the simulations and the experiment, caused by the trapezoidal cross-section of the structure. The revealed long-distance spin-wave propagation on the nanoscale is particularly interesting for an application in spin-wave devices, allowing for long-distance transport of information in magnonic circuits, as well as novel low-energy device architectures.

RbVSbsingle crystals show a superconducting transition at0.92 K. Meanwhile, resistivity, magnetization and heat capacity measurements indicate that it exhibits anomalies of properties at102 - 103 K, possibly related to the formation of charge ordering state. Whenis lower than, the Hall coefficientundergoes a drastic change and sign reversal from negative to positive, which can be partially explained by the enhanced mobility of hole-type carriers. In addition, the results of quantum oscillations show that there are some very small Fermi surfaces with low effective mass, consistent with the existence of multiple highly dispersive Dirac band near the Fermi energy level.	
[2101.10194] Quantum Polarization of Qudit Channels	Ashutosh GoswamiMehdi MhallaValentin SavinUniv. Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble INP, LIG, F-38000 Grenoble, FranceUniv. Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Grenoble INP, LIG, F-38000 Grenoble, FranceUniv. Grenoble Alpes, CEA, LETI, F-38054 Grenoble, France			We provide a generalization of quantum polar codes to quantum channels with qudit-input, achieving the symmetric coherent information of the channel. Our scheme relies on a channel combining and splitting construction, where a two-qudit unitary randomly chosen from a unitary 2-design is used to combine two instances of a qudit-input channel. The inputs to the synthesized bad channels are frozen by sharing EPR pairs between the sender and the receiver, so our scheme is entanglement assisted. Using the fact that the generalized two-qudit Clifford group forms a unitary 2-design, we conclude that the channel combining operation can be chosen from this set. Moreover, we show that polarization also happens for a much smaller subset of two-qudit Cliffords, which is not a unitary 2-design. Finally, we show how to decode the proposed quantum polar codes on Pauli qudit channels.

We find that such systems are stable, and have long-range orientational order, over a wide range of parameters. When stable, these systems exhibit “giant number fluctuations”, which grow as the 3/4th power of the mean number. Stable systems also exhibit anomalous rapid diffusion of tagged particles suspended in the passive fluid along any directions in a plane parallel to the solid-liquid interface, whereas the diffusivity along the direction perpendicular to the plane is not anomalous. In the remaining parameter space, the system becomes unstable.

[2101.10198] Cyber-Physical Energy Systems Security: Threat Modeling, Risk Assessment, Resources, Metrics, and Case Studies	Ioannis Zografopoulos, , Juan Ospina, , XiaoRui Liu, , and Charalambos Konstantinou			Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are interconnected architectures that employ analog, digital, and communication resources for their interaction with the physical environment. CPS are the backbone of enterprise, industrial, and critical infrastructure. Thus, their vital importance makes them prominent targets for malicious attacks aiming to disrupt their operations. Attacks targeting cyber-physical energy systems (CPES), given their mission-critical nature, can have disastrous consequences. The security of CPES can be enhanced leveraging testbed capabilities to replicate power system operations, discover vulnerabilities, develop security countermeasures, and evaluate grid operation under fault-induced or maliciously constructed scenarios. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the CPS security landscape with emphasis on CPES. Specifically, we demonstrate a threat modeling methodology to accurately represent the CPS elements, their interdependencies, as well as the possible attack entry points and system vulnerabilities. Leveraging the threat model formulation, we present a CPS framework designed to delineate the hardware, software, and modeling resources required to simulate the CPS and construct high-fidelity models which can be used to evaluate the system’s performance under adverse scenarios. The system performance is assessed using scenario-specific metrics, while risk assessment enables system vulnerability prioritization factoring the impact on the system operation. The overarching framework for modeling, simulating, assessing, and mitigating attacks in a CPS is illustrated using four representative attack scenarios targeting CPES. The key objective of this paper is to demonstrate a step-by-step process that can be used to enact in-depth cybersecurity analyses, thus leading to more resilient and secure CPS.

Because of this, while biofilm growth is a complex process affected by several variables, insights into biofilm formation could be obtained studying simple schematic models. In this manuscript, we describe a hybrid molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo model for the simulation of the early stage formation of a biofilm, to explicitly demonstrate that it is possible to account for most of the processes expected to be relevant. The simulations account for the growth and reproduction of the bacteria, for their interaction and motility, for the synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances and Psl trails. We describe the effect of these processes on the early stage formation of biofilms, in two dimensions, and also discuss preliminary three-dimensional results.

They analyze the sound by close listening and by leveraging audio metering and audio analysis tools, until they successfully created the desired sound aesthetics. DJs of EDM tend to play sets of songs that meet their sound ideal. We therefore suggest using audio metering and monitoring tools from the recording studio to analyze EDM, instead of relying on conventional low-level audio features. We test our novel set of features by a simple classification task. We attribute songs to DJs who would play the specific song. This new set of features and the focus on DJ sets is targeted at EDM as it takes the producer and DJ culture into account. With simple dimensionality reduction and machine learning these features enable us to attribute a song to a DJ with an accuracy of 63%. The features from the audio metering and monitoring tools in the recording studio could serve for many applications in Music Information Retrieval, such as genre, style and era classification and music recommendation for both DJs and consumers of electronic dance music.

To demonstrate the dominance of quantum computers over classical computers in this regime, here we simulate a semi-empirical model where two neutral particles interact through Lennard-Jones potential in a one dimensional system. We implement the above scenario on IBM quantum experience platform using a 5-qubit real device. We construct the Hamiltonian and then efficiently map it to quantum operators onto quantum gates using the time-evolutionary unitary matrix obtained from the Hamiltonian. We verify the results collected from the qasm-simulator and compare it with that of the 5-qubit real chip ibmqx2.

[2101.10203] ISP Distillation				Nowadays, many of the images captured are ”observed” by machines only and not by humans, for example, robots’ or autonomous cars’ cameras. High-level machine vision models, such as object recognition or semantic segmentation, assume images are transformed to some canonical image space by the camera ISP. However, the camera ISP is optimized for producing visually pleasing images to human observers and not for machines, thus, one may spare the ISP compute time and apply the vision models directly on the raw data. Yet, it has been shown that training such models directly on the RAW images results in a performance drop. To mitigate this drop in performance (without the need to annotate RAW data), we use a dataset of RAW and RGB image pairs, which can be easily acquired with no human labeling. We then train a model that is applied directly on the RAW data by using knowledge distillation such that the model predictions for RAW images will be aligned with the predictions of an off-the-shelf pre-trained model for processed RGB images. Our experiments show that our performance on RAW images for object classification and semantic segmentation are significantly better than a model trained on labeled RAW images. It also reasonably matches the predictions of a pre-trained model on processed RGB images, while saving the ISP compute overhead.	RAW image | Classification | ISP | Knowledge distillation

Walker XianZhong Zheng		urverda@mail.ustc.edu.cn jxw@ustc.edu.cn	Protoclusters, the progenitors of the most massive structures in the Universe, have been identified at redshifts up to 6.6 [refs[1,2,3,4,5,6]]. Besides exploring early structure formation, searching for protoclusters at even higher redshifts is particularly useful to probe the reionization. Here we report the discovery of the protocluster LAGER-7OD1 at redshift of 6.93, when the universe was only 770 million years old and could be experiencing rapid evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium[7,8]. The protocluster is identified by an overdensity of 6 times the average galaxy density, and with 21 narrowband selected Lygalaxies, among which 16 have been spectroscopically confirmed. At redshifts similar to or above this record, smaller protogroups with fewer members have been reported[9,10]. LAGER-7OD1 shows an elongated shape and consists of two sub-protoclusters, which would have merged into one massive cluster with a present-day mass ofsolar masses. The total volume of the ionized bubbles generated by its member galaxies is found to be comparable to the volume of the protocluster itself, indicating that we are witnessing the merging of the individual bubbles and that the intergalactic medium within the protocluster is almost fully ionized. LAGER-7OD1 thus provides a unique natural laboratory to investigate the reionization process.

[2101.10208] Back–Projection Pipeline	Pablo Navarrete Michelini,1Hanwen Liu,1Yunhua Lu,1Xingqun Jiang,1			We propose a simple extension of residual networks that works simultaneously in multiple resolutions. Our network design is inspired by the iterative back–projection algorithm but seeks the more difficult task of learning how to enhance images. Compared to similar approaches, we propose a novel solution to make back–projections run in multiple resolutions by using a data pipeline workflow. Features are updated at multiple scales in each layer of the network. The update dynamic through these layers includes interactions between different resolutions in a way that is causal in scale, and it is represented by a system of ODEs, as opposed to a single ODE in the case of ResNets. The system can be used as a generic multi–resolution approach to enhance images. We test it on several challenging tasks with special focus on super–resolution and raindrop removal. Our results are competitive with state–of–the–arts and show a strong ability of our system to learn both global and local image features.

The device is based on the asymmetric loading of a highly-confining silicon-slot photonic coupler with graphene layers, whose ultrafast and low-threshold saturable absorption can be exploited for nonreciprocal transmission between the cross-ports of the coupler. The structure is essentially a non-Hermitian system, whose exceptional points are briefly discussed. The nonlinear device is modeled with a coupled Schrödinger equation system whose validity is checked by full-vector finite element-based beam-propagation method simulations in CW. The numerically computed performance reveals a nonreciprocal intensity range (NRIR) in the vicinity of 100 mW peak power with a bandwidth spanning tens of nanometers, from CW down to ps-long pulses. Finally, the combination of saturable absorption and self-phase modulation (Kerr effect) in graphene is studied, indicating the existence of two NRIR with opposite directionality.

Zhukov Roland Bouffanais Natalia N. Konobeeva Evgeniya V. Boroznina Boris A. Malomed Hervé Leblond Dumitru Mihalache Mikhail B. Belonenko Nikolay N. Rosanov Thomas F. George	ITMO University 197101 Saint Petersburg Russia		We present a study of the propagation of three-dimensional (3D) bipolar electromagnetic ultrashort pulses in an inhomogeneous array of semiconductor carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the presence of a control high-frequency (HF) electric field. The inhomogeneity is present in the form of a layer with an increased concentration of conduction electrons, which acts as a barrier for the propagation of ultrashort electromagnetic pulses through the CNT array. The dynamics of the pulse is described by a nonlinear equation for the vector potential of the electromagnetic field (it takes the form of a 3D generalization of the sine-Gordon equation), derived from the Maxwell’s equations and averaged over the period of the HF control field. By means of systematic simulations, we demonstrate that, depending on the amplitude and frequency of the HF control, the ultrashort pulse approaching the barrier layer either passes it or bounces back. The layer’s transmissivity for the incident pulse is significantly affected by the amplitude and frequency of the HF control field, with the reflection coefficient nearly vanishing in intervals that make up a discrete set of transparency windows, which resembles the effect of the electromagnetically-induced transparency. Having passed the barrier, the ultrashort pulse continues to propagate, keeping its spatiotemporal integrity. The results may be used for the design of soliton valves, with the transmissivity of the soliton stream accurately controlled by the HF field.	pacs:42.65.Tg | 42.65.Sf | 78.67.-n | 78.67.Ch
[2101.10213] A Trigger-Sense Memory Flow Framework for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction	Yongliang Shen Xinyin Ma Yechun Tang Weiming Lu	Zhejiang	syl@zju.edu.cn luwm@zju.edu.cn tangyechun@zju.edu.cn maxinyin@zju.edu.cn	Joint entity and relation extraction framework constructs a unified model to perform entity recognition and relation extraction simultaneously, which can exploit the dependency between the two tasks to mitigate the error propagation problem suffered by the pipeline model. Current efforts on joint entity and relation extraction focus on enhancing the interaction between entity recognition and relation extraction through parameter sharing, joint decoding, or other ad-hoc tricks (e.g., modeled as a semi-Markov decision process, cast as a multi-round reading comprehension task). However, there are still two issues on the table. First, the interaction utilized by most methods is still weak and uni-directional, which is unable to model the mutual dependency between the two tasks. Second, relation triggers are ignored by most methods, which can help explain why humans would extract a relation in the sentence. They’re essential for relation extraction but overlooked. To this end, we present aTrigger-Sense Memory Flow Framework (TriMF)for joint entity and relation extraction. We build a memory module to remember category representations learned in entity recognition and relation extraction tasks. And based on it, we design a multi-level memory flow attention mechanism to enhance the bi-directional interaction between entity recognition and relation extraction. Moreover, without any human annotations, our model can enhance relation trigger information in a sentence through a trigger sensor module, which improves the model performance and makes model predictions with better interpretation. Experiment results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results by improves the relation F1 to 52.44% (+3.2%) on SciERC, 66.49% (+4.9%) on ACE05, 72.35% (+0.6%) on CoNLL04 and 80.66% (+2.3%) on ADE.	
[2101.10214] 1 Introduction			riccardo.hertel@ipcms.unistra.fr	Skyrmions are chiral swirling magnetization structures with nanoscale size. These structures have attracted considerable attention due to their topological stability and promising applicability in nanodevices, since they can be displaced with spin-polarized currents. However, for the comprehensive implementation of skyrmions in devices, it is imperative to also attain control over their geometrical position. Here we show that, through thickness modulations introduced in the host material, it is possible to constrain three-dimensional skyrmions to desired regions. We investigate skyrmion structures in rectangular FeGe platelets with micromagnetic finite element element simulations. First, we establish a phase diagram of the minimum-energy magnetic state as a function of the external magnetic field strength and the film thickness. Using this understanding, we generate preferential sites for skyrmions in the material by introducing dot-like “pockets” of reduced film thickness. We show that these pockets can serve as pinning centers for the skyrmions, thus making it possible to obtain a geometric control of the skyrmion position. This control allows stabilizing skyrmions at positions and in configurations that they would otherwise not attain. Our findings may have implications for technological applications in which skyrmions are used as units of information that are displaced along racetrack-type shift register devices.

We provide numerical results to show that our proposed algorithms behave as well as the best known scheduling and routing schemes available in the literature for a wide variety of network settings.

However, the deep learning methods used in general object detection are not suitable for robotic grasping detection. Current modern object detectors are difficult to strike a balance between high accuracy and fast inference speed. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust fully convolutional neural network model to perform robotic grasping pose estimation from n-channel input image of the real grasping scene. The proposed network is a lightweight generative architecture for grasping detection in one stage. Specifically, a grasping representation based on Guassian kernel is introduced to encode training samples, which embodies the principle of maximum central point grasping confidence. Meanwhile, to extract multi-scale information and enhance the feature discriminability, a receptive field block (RFB) is assembled to the bottleneck of our grasping detection architecture. Besides, pixel attention and channel attention are combined to automatically learn to focus on fusing context information of varying shapes and sizes by suppressing the noise feature and highlighting the grasping object feature. Extensive experiments on two public grasping datasets, Cornell and Jacquard demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method in balancing accuracy and inference speed. The network is an order of magnitude smaller than other excellent algorithms, while achieving better performance with accuracy of 98.9and 95.6on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets, respectively.

The UAP can be stated as follows. Letandbe the dimension of input and output data, and assume. Then we show that ODENet widthwith any non-polynomial continuous activation function can approximate any continuous function on a compact subset on. We also show that ResNet has the same property as the depth tends to infinity. Furthermore, we derive explicitly the gradient of a loss function with respect to a certain tuning variable. We use this to construct a learning algorithm for ODENet. To demonstrate the usefulness of this algorithm, we apply it to a regression problem, a binary classification, and a multinomial classification in MNIST.	
[2101.10230] Minimal elements for the limit weak order on affine Weyl groups	Christian Gaetz Yibo Gao	Department of Mathematics Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge MA	gaetz@mit.edu gaoyibo@mit.edu	The limit weak order on an affine Weyl group was introduced by Lam and Pylyavskyy[5]in their study of total positivity for loop groups[4]. They showed that in the case of the affine symmetric group the minimal elements of this poset coincide with the infinite fully commutative reduced words and with infinite powers of Coxeter elements. We answer several open problems raised there by classifying minimal elements in all affine types and relating these elements to the classes of fully commutative and Coxeter elements. Interestingly, the infinite fully commutative elements correspond to the minuscule and cominuscule nodes of the Dynkin diagram, while the infinite Coxeter elements correspond to a single node, which we call theheavynode, in all affine types other than type.	
[2101.10231] Creating a Virtuous Cycle in Performance Testing at MongoDB	David Daly	0000-0001-9678-3721MongoDB	david.daly@mongodb.com	It is important to detect changes in software performance during development in order to avoid performance decreasing release to release or dealing with costly delays at release time. Performance testing is part of the development process at MongoDB, and integrated into our continuous integration system. We describe a set of changes to that performance testing environment designed to improve testing effectiveness. These changes help improve coverage, provide faster and more accurate signaling for performance changes, and help us better understand the state of performance. In addition to each component performing better, we believe that we have created and exploited a virtuous cycle: performance test improvements drive impact, which drives more use, which drives further impact and investment in improvements. Overall, MongoDB is getting faster and we avoid shipping major performance regressions to our customers because of this infrastructure.	change point detection | performance | testing | continuous integration | variability

[2101.10233] Data Flow Analysis of Asynchronous Systems using Infinite Abstract Domains	Snigdha Athaiya Raghavan Komondoor K. Narayan Kumar	institutetext:	kumar@cmi.ac.in	Asynchronous message-passing systems are employed frequently to implement distributed mechanisms, protocols, and processes. This paper addresses the problem of precise data flow analysis for such systems. To obtain good precision, data flow analysis needs to somehow skip execution paths that read more messages than the number of messages sent so far in the path, as such paths are infeasible at run time. Existing data flow analysis techniques do elide a subset of such infeasible paths, but have the restriction that they admit only finite abstract analysis domains. In this paper we propose a generalization of these approaches to admit infinite abstract analysis domains, as such domains are commonly used in practice to obtain high precision. We have implemented our approach, and have analyzed its performance on a set of 14 benchmarks. On these benchmarks our tool obtains significantly higher precision compared to a baseline approach that does not elide any infeasible paths and to another baseline that elides infeasible paths but admits only finite abstract domains.

In such cases, obtaining the initial condition independent stead states is highly nontrivial since any linear combination of thetrueasymptotic states, which may not necessarily be a density matrix, is also a valid asymptote for the Liouvillian. Thus, in this work we consider different approaches to obtain thetruesteady states of a degenerated Liouvillian. In the ideal scenario, when the open system symmetry operators are known we show how these can be used to obtain the invariant subspaces of the Liouvillian and hence the steady states. We then discuss two other approaches that do not require any knowledge of the symmetry operators. These could be a powerful tool to deal with quantum many-body complex open systems. The first approach which is based on Gramm-Schmidt orthonormalization of density matrices allows us to obtainallthe steady states, whereas the second one based on large deviations allows us to obtain the non-degenerated maximum and minimum current-carrying states. We discuss our method with the help of an open para-Benzene ring and examine interesting scenarios such as the dynamical restoration of Hamiltonian symmetries in the long-time limit and apply the method to study the eigenspacing statistics of the nonequilibrium steady state.	
[2101.10237] Eigenmodes and resonance vibrations of 2D nanomembranes – Graphene and hexagonal boron-nitride	Alexander V. Savin	N.N. Semenov Federal Research Center for Chemical Physics Russian Academy of Sciences (FRCCP RAS) Moscow 119991 Russia		Natural and resonant oscillations of suspended circular graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) membranes (single-layer sheets lying on a flat substrate having a circular hole of radius) have been simulated using full-atomic models. Substrates formed by flat surfaces of graphite and h-BN crystal, hexagonal ice, silicon carbide 6H-SiC and nickel surface (111) have been used. The presence of the substrate leads to the forming of a gap at the bottom of the frequency spectrum of transversal vibrations of the sheet. The frequencies of natural oscillations of the membrane (oscillations localized on the suspended section of the sheet) always lie in this gap, and the frequencies of oscillations decrease by increasing radius of the membrane aswith nonezero effective increase of radius. The modeling of the sheet dynamics has shown that small periodic transversal displacements of the substrate lead to resonant vibrations of the membranes at frequencies close to eigenfrequencies of nodeless vibrations of membranes with a circular symmetry. The energy distribution of resonant vibrations of the membrane has a circular symmetry and several nodal circles, whose numbercoincides with the number of the resonant frequency. The frequencies of the resonances decrease by increasing the radius of the membrane aswith exponent. The lower rate of resonance frequency decrease is caused by the anharmonicity of membrane vibrations.

Fuchs	School of Applied and Engineering Physics Cornell University Ithaca NY 14853 USA	gdf9@cornell.edu	Vanadium tetracyanoethylene (V[TCNE],) is an organic-based ferrimagnet with a high magnetic ordering temperature, low magnetic damping, and growth compatibility with a wide variety of substrates. However, similar to other organic-based materials, it is sensitive to air. Although encapsulation of V[TCNE]with glass and epoxy extends the film lifetime from an hour to a few weeks, what is limiting its lifetime remains poorly understood. Here we characterize encapsulated V[TCNE]films using confocal microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, ferromagnetic resonance and SQUID magnetometry. We identify the relevant features in the Raman spectra in agreement withab initiotheory, reproducingvibrational modes. We correlate changes in the effective dynamic magnetization with changes in Raman intensity and in photoluminescence. Based on changes in Raman spectra, we hypothesize possible structural changes and aging mechanisms in V[TCNE]. These findings enable a local optical probe of V[TCNE]film quality, which is invaluable in experiments where assessing film quality with local magnetic characterization is not possible.	
[2101.10241] RGB-D Salient Object Detection via 3D Convolutional Neural Networks	Qian Chen1, Ze Liu1, Yi Zhang2, Keren Fu3,4, Qijun Zhao3,4, Hongwei Du1	Corresponding author: Keren	fkrsuper@scu.edu.cn	RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) recently has attracted increasing research interest and many deep learning methods based on encoder-decoder architectures have emerged. However, most existing RGB-D SOD models conduct feature fusion either in the single encoder or the decoder stage, which hardly guarantees sufficient cross-modal fusion ability. In this paper, we make the first attempt in addressing RGB-D SOD through 3D convolutional neural networks. The proposed model, namedRD3D, aims at pre-fusion in the encoder stage and in-depth fusion in the decoder stage to effectively promote the full integration of RGB and depth streams. Specifically,RD3Dfirst conducts pre-fusion across RGB and depth modalities through an inflated 3D encoder, and later provides in-depth feature fusion by designing a 3D decoder equipped with rich back-projection paths (RBPP) for leveraging the extensive aggregation ability of 3D convolutions. With such a progressive fusion strategy involving both the encoder and decoder, effective and thorough interaction between the two modalities can be exploited and boost the detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on six widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate thatRD3Dperforms favorably against 14 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD approaches in terms of four key evaluation metrics. Our code will be made publicly available: https://github.com/PPOLYpubki/RD3D.	
[2101.10242] Between Synchrony and Turbulence: Intricate Hierarchies of Coexistence Patterns	Sindre W. Haugland Anton Tosolini Katharina Krischer	Department Nonequilibrium Chemical Physics Technical University of Munich James-Franck-Str. 1 D-85748 Garching Germany	krischer@tum.de	Coupled oscillators, even identical ones, display a wide range of behaviours, among them synchrony and incoherence. The 2002 discovery of so-called chimera states, states of coexisting synchronized and unsynchronized oscillators, provided a possible link between the two and definitely showed that different parts of the same ensemble can sustain qualitatively different forms of motion. Here, we demonstrate that globally coupled identical oscillators can express a range of coexistence patterns more comprehensive than chimeras. A hierarchy of such states evolves from the fully synchronized solution in a series of cluster-splittings. At the far end of this hierarchy, the states further collide with their own mirror-images in phase space – rendering the motion chaotic, destroying some of the clusters and thereby producing even more intricate coexistence patterns. A sequence of such attractor collisions can ultimately lead to full incoherence of only single asynchronous oscillators. Chimera states, with one large synchronized cluster and else only single oscillators, are found to be just one step in this transition from low- to high-dimensional dynamics.

[2101.10245] AirWare: Utilizing Embedded Audio and Infrared Signals for In-Air Hand-Gesture Recognition	Nibhrat Lohia Raunak Mundada Arya D. McCarthy Eric C. Larson		nlohia@smu.edu rmundada@smu.edu	We introduce AirWare, an in-air hand-gesture recognition system that uses the already embedded speaker and microphone in most electronic devices, together with embedded infrared proximity sensors. Gestures identified by AirWare are performed in the air above a touchscreen or a mobile phone. AirWare utilizes convolutional neural networks to classify a large vocabulary of hand gestures using multi-modal audio Doppler signatures and infrared (IR) sensor information. As opposed to other systems which use high frequency Doppler radars or depth cameras to uniquely identify in-air gestures, AirWare does not require any external sensors. In our analysis, we use openly available APIs to interface with the Samsung Galaxy S5 audio and proximity sensors for data collection. We find that AirWare is not reliable enough for a deployable interaction system when trying to classify a gesture set of 21 gestures, with an average true positive rate of only 50.5% per gesture. To improve performance, we train AirWare to identify subsets of the 21 gestures vocabulary based on possible usage scenarios. We find that AirWare can identify three gesture sets with average true positive rate greater than 80% using 4–7 gestures per set, which comprises a vocabulary of 16 unique in-air gestures.

We propose a new approach leveraging the Seldonian optimization framework from AI safety and demonstrate how it can be adapted to epidemic forecasting. We study two types of guidance: smoothness and regional consistency of errors, where we show that by its successful incorporation, we are able to not only bound the probability of undesirable behavior to happen, but also to reduce RMSE on test data by up to 17%.

Papież	institutetext:	bartlomiej.papiez@bdi.ox.ac.uk	Alignment of contrast and non contrast-enhanced imaging is essential for quantification of changes in several biomedical applications. In particular, the extraction of cartilage shape from contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) of tibiae requires accurate alignment of the bone, currently performed manually. Existing deep learning-based methods for alignment require a common template or are limited in rotation range. Therefore, we present a novel network, D-net, to estimate arbitrary rotation and translation between 3D CT scans that additionally does not require a prior template. D-net is an extension to the branched Siamese encoder-decoder structure connected by new mutual non-local links, which efficiently capture long-range connections of similar features between two branches. The 3D supervised network is trained and validated using preclinical CT scans of mouse tibiae with and without contrast enhancement in cartilage. The presented results show a significant improvement in the estimation of CT alignment, outperforming the current comparable methods.

While improving the different components of these systems has been the focus of numerous studies, estimating the impact of such improvements on the revenue has been overlooked in the literature despite its practical importance. Indeed, quantifying the benefit of a change in a system serves as support for investment decisions. This is a challenging problem as it corresponds to the difference between the generated value and the value that would have been generated keeping the system as before. The latter is not observable. Moreover, the expected impact can be small in relative value.	
[2101.10250] Learning From Revisions: Quality Assessment of Claims in Argumentation at Scale	Gabriella Skitalinskaya Jonas KlaffDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of BremenBremen, Germany{gabski,  Henning WachsmuthDepartment of Computer SciencePaderborn UniversityPaderborn,		henningw@upb.de	Assessing the quality of arguments and of the claims the arguments are composed of has become a key task in computational argumentation. However, even if different claims share the same stance on the same topic, their assessment depends on the prior perception and weighting of the different aspects of the topic being discussed. This renders it difficult to learn topic-independent quality indicators. In this paper, we study claim quality assessment irrespective of discussed aspects by comparing differentrevisions of the same claim. We compile a large-scale corpus with over 377k claim revision pairs of various types fromkialo.com, covering diverse topics from politics, ethics, entertainment, and others. We then propose two tasks: (a) assessing which claim of a revision pair is better, and (b) ranking all versions of a claim by quality. Our first experiments with embedding-based logistic regression and transformer-based neural networks show promising results, suggesting that learned indicators generalize well across topics. In a detailed error analysis, we give insights into what quality dimensions of claims can be assessed reliably. We provide the data and scripts needed to reproduce all results.111Data and code:https://github.com/GabriellaSky/claimrev

On information geometry, the-connection and the-connection are important, which do not coincide with the Levi-Civita one. Therefore, it is interesting to consider a Hessian manifold with a flat connection which does not coincide with the Levi-Civita one. We call it a proper Hessian manifold. In this paper, we show that any compact proper Hesse soliton is expanding and any non-trivial compact gradient Hesse soliton is proper. Furthermore, we show that the dual space of a Hesse-Einstein manifold can be understood as a Hesse soliton.	Key words and phrases:Hesse flow; Hesse solitons; Hessian manifolds; Information geometry

It will also very likely add many merger events of black hole - neutron star binaries. Distinguishing mixed binaries from binary black holes mergers for high mass ratios could be challenging because in this situation the neutron star coalesces with the black hole without experiencing significant disruption. To investigate the transition of mixed binary mergers into those behaving more like binary black hole coalescences, we present results from merger simulations for different mass ratios. We show how the degree of deformation and disruption of the neutron star impacts the inspiral and merger dynamics, the properties of the final black hole, the accretion disk formed from the circularization of the tidal debris, the gravitational waves, and the strain spectrum and mismatches. The results also show the effectiveness of the initial data method that generalizes the Bowen-York initial data for black hole punctures to the case of binaries with neutron star companions.

Consequently, it will become a key enabler with the emerging fifth-generation (5G) and beyond 5G communications, Internet of Things networks, among others. State-of-the-art studies in wireless signal recognition have only focused on a single task which in many cases is insufficient information for a system to act on. In this work, for the first time in the wireless communication domain, we exploit the potential of deep neural networks in conjunction with multi-task learning (MTL) framework to simultaneously learn modulation and signal classification tasks. The proposed MTL architecture benefits from the mutual relation between the two tasks in improving the classification accuracy as well as the learning efficiency with a lightweight neural network model. Additionally, we consider the problem of heterogeneous wireless signals such as radar and communication signals in the electromagnetic spectrum. Accordingly, we have shown how the proposed MTL model outperforms several state-of-the-art single-task learning classifiers while maintaining a lighter architecture and performing two signal characterization tasks simultaneously. Finally, we also release the only known open heterogeneous wireless signals dataset that comprises of radar and communication signals with multiple labels.	machine learning | multi-task learning | signal classification | modulation classification

Dependence can be parametric, parametric with increasing dimension, semiparametric or any combination thereof, thus covering a vast variety of settings. These include spatial error models of varying types and levels of complexity. Under a new smooth spatial dependence condition, our test statistic is asymptotically standard normal. To prove the latter property, we establish a central limit theorem for quadratic forms in linear processes in an increasing dimension setting. Finite sample performance is investigated in a simulation study, with a bootstrap method also justified and illustrated. Empirical examples illustrate the test with real-world data.	
[2101.10256] Ridge approximation for thin nematic polymer networks	Andrea Pedrini Epifanio G. Virga		eg.virga@unipv.it andrea.pedrini@unipv.it	Nematic polymer networks (NPNs) are nematic elastomers within which the nematic director is enslaved to the elastic deformation. The elastic free energy of a NPN sheet of thicknesshas both stretching and bending components (the former scaling like, the latter scaling like). NPN sheets bear a director fieldimprinted in them (usually, uniformly throughout their thickness); they can be activated by changing the nematic order (e.g. by illumination or heating). This paper illustrates an attempt to compute the bending energy of a NPN sheet and to show which role it can play in determining the activated shape. Our approach is approximate: the activated surface consists of flat sectors connected byridges, where the unit normal jumps and the bending energy is concentrated. By increasing the number of ridges, we should get closer to the real situation, where the activated surface is smooth and the bending energy is distributed on it. The method is applied to a disk with imprinted a spiraling hedgehog. It is shown that upon activation the disk, like a tiny hand, is able to grab a rigid lamina.

Instead of using Gaussian signals as most of the previous works, this paper makes a novel contribution by investigating the transmission quality of image data by utilizing the Massive MIMO technology. We first construct a framework to decode the image signal from the noisy received data in the uplink Massive MIMO transmission by utilizing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach. Then, a low-pass filter is exploited to enhance the efficiency of the remaining noise and artifacts reduction in the recovered image. Numerical results demonstrate the necessity of a post-filtering process in enhancing the quality of image recovery.	Massive MIMO | Image Communications | Low-Pass Filters | Image Smoothing.
[2101.10259] Registration-based model reduction in complex two-dimensional geometries.			tommaso.taddei@inria.fr lei.a.zhang@inria.fr	We present a general — i.e., independent of the underlying equation — registration procedure for parameterized model order reduction. Given the spatial domainand the manifoldassociated with the parameter domainand the parametric field, our approach takes as input a set of snapshotsand returns a parameter-dependent bijective mapping: the mapping is designed to make the mapped manifoldmore amenable for linear compression methods. In this work, we extend and further analyze the registration approach proposed in [Taddei, SISC, 2020]. The contributions of the present work are twofold. First, we extend the approach to deal with annular domains by introducing a suitable transformation of the coordinate system. Second, we discuss the extension to general two-dimensional geometries: towards this end, we introduce a spectral element approximation, which relies on a partitionof the domainsuch thatare isomorphic to the unit square. We further show that our spectral element approximation can cope with parameterized geometries. We present rigorous mathematical analysis to justify our proposal; furthermore, we present numerical results for a heat-transfer problem in an annular domain, a potential flow past a rotating symmetric airfoil, and an inviscid transonic compressible flow past a non-symmetric airfoil, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.	
[2101.10260] VConstruct: Filling Gaps in Chl-a Data Using a Variational Autoencoder	Matthew EhrlerDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of VictoriaVictoria  Neil ErnstDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of VictoriaVictoria		mehrler@uvic.ca nernst@uvic.ca	Remote sensing of Chlorophyll-a is vital in monitoring climate change. Chlorphyll-a measurements give us an idea of the algae concentrations in the ocean, which lets us monitor ocean health. However, a common problem is that the satellites used to gather the data are commonly obstructed by clouds and other artifacts. This means that time series data from satellites can suffer from spatial data loss. There are a number of algorithms that are able to reconstruct the missing parts of these images to varying degrees of accuracy, with Data INterpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) being the current standard. However, DINEOF is slow, suffers from accuracy loss in temporally homogenous waters, reliant on temporal data, and only able to generate a single potential reconstruction. We propose a machine learning approach to reconstruction of Chlorophyll-a data using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Our accuracy results to date are competitive with but slightly less accurate than DINEOF. We show the benefits of our method including vastly decreased computation time and ability to generate multiple potential reconstructions. Lastly, we outline our planned improvements and future work.

Traditional econometric methodologies for building discrete choice models for policy analysis involve combining data with modeling assumptions guided by subject-matter considerations. Such considerations are typically most useful in specifying thesystematiccomponent of random utility discrete choice models but are typically of limited aid in determining the form of therandomcomponent. We identify an area where machine learning paradigms can be leveraged, namely in specifying and systematically selecting the best specification of therandomcomponent of the utility equations. We review two recent novel applications where mixed-integer optimization and cross-validation are used to algorithmically select optimal specifications for the random utility components of nested logit and logit mixture models subject to interpretability constraints.

We then study a deformation to the normal cone construction in the setting of derived algebraic geometry. Applied to the unit section of a formal groupthis provides a-equivariant degeneration ofto its tangent Lie algebra. We prove a unicity result on complete filtrations, which, in particular, identifies the resulting filtration on the coordinate algebra of this deformation with the adic filtration on the coordinate algebra of. We use this in a special case, together with the aforementioned notion of Cartier duality, to recover the filtration on the filtered circle of[MRT19]. Finally, we investigate some properties of-Hochschild homology, set out in loc. cit., and describe “lifts” of these invariants to the setting of spectral algebraic geometry.

Traditionally, community prevalence has been assessed through diagnostic and antibody testing data. However, despite the increasing availability of COVID-19 testing, the required level has not been met in most parts of the globe, introducing a need for an alternative method for communities to determine disease prevalence. This is further complicated by the observation that COVID-19 prevalence and spread varies across different spatial, temporal and demographics. In this study, we understand trends in the spread of COVID-19 by utilizing the results of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms surveys as an alternative to COVID-19 testing reports. This allows us to assess community disease prevalence, even in areas with low COVID-19 testing ability. Using individually reported symptom data from various populations, our method predicts the likely percentage of population that tested positive for COVID-19. We do so with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.14 and Mean Relative error (MRE) of 60.40% with 95% confidence interval as (60.12, 60.67). This implies that our model predicts +/- 1140 cases than original in a population of 1 million. In addition, we forecast the location-wise percentage of the population testing positive for the next 30 days using self-reported symptoms data from previous days. The MAE for this method is as low as 0.15 (MRE of 23.61% with 95% confidence interval as (23.6, 13.7)) for New York. We present analysis on these results, exposing various clinical attributes of interest across different demographics. Lastly, we qualitatively analyse how various policy enactments (testing, curfew) affect the prevalence of COVID-19 in a community.

[2101.10270] Probing 𝜇eV ALPs with future LHAASO observation of AGN 𝛾-ray spectra	Guangbo Long Siyu Chen Shuo Xu Hong-Hao Zhang	of Physics Sun Yat-Sen University Guangzhou 510275 China	zhh98@mail.sysu.edu.cn	Axion-like particles (ALPs) are predicted in some well-motivated theories beyond the Standard Model. The TeV gamma-rays from active galactic nuclei (AGN) suffer attenuation by the pair production interactions with the cosmic background light (EBL/CMB) during its travel to the earth. The attenuation can be circumvented through photon-ALP conversions in the AGN and Galaxy magnetic-field, and a flux enhancement is expected to arise in the observed spectrum. In this work, we study the potential of the AGN gamma-ray spectrum for energy up to above 100 TeV to probe ALP-parameter space at aroundeV, where the couplingis so far relatively weakly constrained. We find the nearby and bright sources, Mrk 501, IC 310 and M 87, are suitable for our objective. Assuming an intrinsic spectrum exponential cutoff energy, we extrapolate the observed spectra of these sources up to above 100 TeV by the models with/without ALPs. ForwitheV, the flux at around 100 TeV predicted by the ALP model can be enhanced more than an order of magnitude than that from the standard absorption, and could be detected by LHAASO. Our result is subject to the uncertainty from the intrinsic cutoff energy and the AGN lobe (or plume) magnetic-field. For an optimistic estimation, the constraint can be improved towitheV. This require further observations on these sources by the forthcoming CTA, LHAASO, SWGO and so on.

For each given integer, we prove that the number of torsion points lying on a smooth complex algebraic curve of genusembedded into its Jacobian is uniformly bounded. Complementing other recent work of Dimitrov, Gao, and Habegger, we obtain a rather uniform version of the Mordell conjecture as well. In particular, the number of rational points on a smooth algebraic curve defined over a number field can be bounded solely in terms of its genus and the Mordell-Weil rank of its Jacobian.	2010 Mathematics Subject Classification:11G50 (primary) | and 11G30 | 14G05 | 14G40 | 14H40 (secondary)

[2101.10274] Extraction of the multiplicity dependence of Multiparton Interactions from LHC pp data using Machine Learning techniques	Antonio Ortiz Erik Zepeda		eazg@ciencias.unam.mx antonio.ortiz@nucleares.unam.mx	Over the last years, Machine Learning (ML) methods have been successfully applied to a wealth of problems in high-energy physics. For instance, in a previous work we have reported that using ML techniques one can extract the Multiparton Interactions (MPI) activity from minimum-bias pp data. Using the available LHC data on transverse momentum spectra as a function of multiplicity, we reported the average number of MPI () for minimum-bias pp collisions atand 13 TeV. In this work, we apply the same analysis to a new set of data. We report thatamounts tofor minimum-bias pp collisions atTeV. These complementary results suggest a modest center-of-mass energy dependence of. The study is further extended aimed at extracting the multiplicity dependence offor the three center-of-mass energies. We show that our results qualitatively agree with existing ALICE measurements sensitive to MPI. Namely,increases approximately linearly with the charged-particle multiplicity. But, it deviates from the linear dependence at large charged-particle multiplicities. The deviation from the linear trend can be explained in terms of a bias towards harder processes given the multiplicity selection at mid-pseudorapidity. The results reported in this paper provide additional evidence of the presence of MPI in pp collisions, and they can be useful for a better understanding of the heavy-ion-like behaviour observed in pp data.

Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are a well-known class of synthetic intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which exhibit a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) in pure water. The LCST transition can be further tuned by proline isomerization. Here, we study and compare the influence ofcis/transproline isomerization on the collapse of single ELPs in aqueous solution. Our results reveal thatcisisomers play an important role in tuning the phase behavior of ELPs by hindering peptide-water hydrogen bonding while promoting intramolecular interactions.

In this article, we explain how to combine recent deep learning advances with the well known technique of quantum walks applied to a Metropolis algorithm. The result, QFold, is a fully scalable hybrid quantum algorithm that, in contrast to previous quantum approaches, does not require a lattice model simplification and instead relies on the much more realistic assumption of parameterization in terms of torsion angles of the amino acids. We compare it with its classical analog for different annealing schedules and find a polynomial quantum advantage, and implement a minimal realization of the quantum Metropolis in IBMQ Casablanca quantum system.

This system requires accurate transient modeling, lower computation cost, and fewer observation data. To tackle these three challenges, we propose a novel deep learning approach using black-box knowledge distillation for both accurate and efficient transmission dynamics prediction in a practical manner. First, we leverage mixture models to develop an accurate, comprehensive, yet impractical simulation system. Next, we use simulated observation sequences to query the simulation system to retrieve simulated projection sequences as knowledge. Then, with the obtained query data, sequence mixup is proposed to improve query efficiency, increase knowledge diversity, and boost distillation model accuracy. Finally, we train a student deep neural network with the retrieved and mixed observation-projection sequences for practical use. The case study on COVID-19 justifies that our approach accurately projects infections with much lower computation cost when observation data are limited.

Mingyu Cai Shaoping Xiao Zhijun Li and Zhen Kan	thanks:		This paper studies the control synthesis of motion planning subject to uncertainties. The uncertainties are considered in robot motions and environment properties, giving rise to the probabilistic labeled Markov decision process (PL-MDP).A Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodis developed to generate a finite-memory control policy to satisfy high-level tasks expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas. One of the novelties is to translate LTL into a limit deterministic generalized Büchi automaton (LDGBA) and develop a corresponding embedded LDGBA (E-LDGBA) by incorporating a tracking-frontier function to overcome the issue of sparse accepting rewards, resulting in improved learning performance and allowing to apply deterministic policies. Due to potentially conflicting tasks, a relaxed product MDP is developed to allow the agent to revise its motion plan without strictly following the desired LTL constraints if the specified tasks can only be partially fulfilled. An expected return composed of violation rewards and accepting rewards is developed. The designed violation function quantifies the differences between the revised and the desired motion plans, while the accepting rewards are proposed to enforce the satisfaction of the acceptance condition of the relaxed product MDP. Rigorous analysis shows that any RL algorithm that optimizes the expected return is guaranteed to find policies that, in decreasing order, can 1) satisfy the acceptance condition of relaxed product MDP and 2) reduce the violation cost over long-term behaviors. Also, we validate the control synthesis approach via simulation and experimental results.	Reinforcement Learning | Formal Methods in Robotics and Automation | Motion Planning

Chernyshenko Davide Lasagna	Email address for of Aeronautics Imperial College London London SW7 2AZ UK	mayur.lakshmi11@imperial.ac.uk	Abstract.We present a novel method to compute unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) that optimize the infinite-time average of a given quantity for polynomial ODE systems. The UPO search procedure relies on polynomial optimization to construct nonnegative polynomials whose sublevel sets approximately localize parts of the optimal UPO, and that can be used to implement a simple yet effective control strategy to reduce the UPO’s instability. Precisely, we construct a family of controlled ODE systems parameterized by a scalarsuch that the original ODE system is recovered for, and such that the optimal orbit is less unstable, or even stabilized, for. Periodic orbits for the controlled system can be more easily converged with traditional methods and numerical continuation inallows one to recover optimal UPOs for the original system. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated on three low-dimensional ODE systems with chaotic dynamics.Keywords.Periodic orbits, nonlinear dynamics, polynomial optimization, auxiliary functions, differential equations	
[2101.10286] Transition from shear-dominated to Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence	Stefano Brizzolara\aff1,5\corresp Jean-Paul Mollicone\aff3,4 Maarten van Reeuwijk\aff3 Andrea Mazzino\aff2 Markus Holzner\aff5,6		brizzolara@ifu.baug.ethz.ch	Turbulent mixing layers in nature are often characterized by the presence of a mean shear and an unstable buoyancy gradient between two streams of different velocity. Depending on the relative strength of shear versus buoyancy, either the former or the latter may dominate the turbulence and mixing between the two streams. In this paper, we present a phenomenological theory that leads to the identification of two distinct turbulent regimes: an early regime, dominated by the mean shear, and a later regime dominated by the buoyancy. The main theoretical result consists of the identification of a cross-over time-scale that discerns between the shear- and the buoyancy-dominated turbulence. This cross-over time depends on three large-scale constants of the flow, namely the buoyancy difference, the velocity difference between the two streams, and the gravitational acceleration. We validate our theory against direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of a temporal turbulent mixing layer compounded with an unstable stratification. We observe that the cross-over time correctly predicts the transition from shear to buoyancy driven turbulence, in terms of turbulent kinetic energy production, energy spectra scaling and mixing layer thickness.	
[2101.10287] Bounds on the heat transfer rate via passive advection	Gautam Iyer Truong-Son Van	Department of Mathematical Sciences Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh PA	tsvan@sas.upenn.edu gautam@math.cmu.edu	In heat exchangers, an incompressible fluid is heated initially and cooled at the boundary. The goal is to transfer the heat to the boundary as efficiently as possible. In this paper we study a related steady version of this problem where a steadily stirred fluid is uniformly heated in the interior and cooled on the boundary. For a given large Péclet number, how should one stir to minimize some norm of the temperature? This version of the problem was previously studied by Marcotte, Doering et al. (SIAM Appl. Math ’18) in a disk, where the authors used matched asymptotics to show that when the Péclet number,, is sufficiently large one can stir the fluid in a manner that ensures the total heat is. In this paper we confirm their results with rigorous proofs, and also provide an almost matching lower bound. For simplicity, we work on the infinite strip instead of the unit disk and the proof uses probabilistic techniques.

We build on previous work on understanding the behaviour of such models within the large-domain limit, where minimisers converge to minimisers of a quadratic elastic energy with manifold-valued constraint, analogous to harmonic maps. We extend this work to establish Hölder bounds for (almost-)minimisers on bounded domains, and demonstrate stronger convergence of (almost)-minimisers away from the singular set of the limit solution. The proof techniques bear analogy with recent work of singularly perturbed energy functionals, in particular in the context of the Ginzburg-Landau and Landau-de Gennes models.	
[2101.10289] Precise Calibration of the One-Loop Trispectrum in the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure	Theodore Steele Tobias Baldauf	of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics University of Cambridge Wilberforce Road CB3 0WA	ts715@cam.ac.uk	The Large-Scale Structure (LSS) of the universe has the potential to provide decisive answers to the remaining open questions in cosmology. Early attempts at modelling it analytically focused on using perturbation theory. However, small-scale effects introduced by gravitational collapse cannot be described perturbatively and this failure of perturbation theory is reflected even on the largest scales. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) has emerged as a consistent method for describing LSS on large scales by introducing counterterms that account for the effects of small-scale dynamics. So far studies of the EFT have mostly focused on the two and three point functions with little attention devoted to the four point function or trispectrum. The trispectrum probes cubic interactions arising from non-linear clustering, biasing, and primordial non-Gaussianities, and constitutes a key element of the covariance matrix of the power spectrum. In this paper, we present explicit calibrations of the EFT counterterms for the one-loop trispectrum. Specifically, we find clear evidence for non-zero EFT corrections. We define two one-parameter ansätze for the counterterm of the one-loop propagator and show that they provide a good correction to the residual at scales below. We then take the amplitudes of the linear and quadratic counterkernels calculated in our previous paper on the bispectrum and use them in the remaining counterterms, establishing consistency of the counterterms in the two, three and four point function. We also show that the commonly used EdS approximation for the growth of the density fields leads to errors that are of the same magnitude as loop corrections to the trispectrum on large scales.

Using techniques from-calculus and a propagation of singularities theorem, we prove that there exist advanced and retarded fundamental solutions, characterizing in addition their structural and microlocal properties. We apply this result to the problem of constructing Hadamard two-point distributions. These are bi-distributions which are weak bi-solutions of the underlying equations of motion with a prescribed form of their wavefront set and whose anti-symmetric part is proportional to the difference between the advanced and the retarded fundamental solutions. In particular, under a suitable restriction of the class of admissible boundary conditions and setting to zero the mass, we prove their existence extending to the case under scrutiny a deformation argument which is typically used on globally hyperbolic spacetimes with empty boundary.

But our field’s understanding of what motivates people to contribute to OSS is still fundamentally grounded in studies from the early 2000s. With the changed landscape of OSS, it is very likely that motivations to join OSS have also evolved. Through a survey of 242 OSS contributors, we investigate shifts in motivation from three perspectives: (1) the impact of the new OSS landscape, (2) the impact of individuals’ personal growth as they become part of OSS communities, and (3) the impact of differences in individuals’ demographics. Our results show that some motivations related to social aspects and reputation increased in frequency and that some intrinsic and internalized motivations, such as learning and intellectual stimulation, are still highly relevant. We also found that contributing to OSS often transforms extrinsic motivations to intrinsic, and that while experienced contributors often shift toward altruism, novices often shift toward career, fun, kinship, and learning. OSS projects can leverage our results to revisit current strategies to attract and retain contributors, and researchers and tool builders can better support the design of new studies and tools to engage and support OSS development.	open source | motivation | incentive

We found that interactiveness knowledge can be learned across HOI datasets and bridge the gap between diverse HOI category settings. Our core idea is to exploit an interactiveness network to learn the general interactiveness knowledge from multiple HOI datasets and perform Non-Interaction Suppression (NIS) before HOI classification in inference. On account of the generalization ability of interactiveness, interactiveness network is a transferable knowledge learner and can be cooperated with any HOI detection models to achieve desirable results. We utilize the human instance and body part features together to learn the interactiveness in hierarchical paradigm, i.e., instance-level and body part-level interactivenesses. Thereafter, a consistency task is proposed to guide the learning and extract deeper interactive visual clues. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on HICO-DET, V-COCO, and a newly constructed PaStaNet-HOI dataset. With the learned interactiveness, our method outperforms state-of-the-art HOI detection methods, verifying its efficacy and flexibility.

However, reasons for the large charge transfer resistances—the major bottleneck of all-solid-state batteries—are still debated. In this article, we explore the processes in incompressible solid electrolytes between blocking electrodes by theory-based continuum modeling and numerical simulations. We investigate the experimentally observed wide space-charge-zones in solid electrolytes, which are a possible cause for the high interfacial resistances. On time scales relevant for battery applications, we reduce our model equations. Analytic and numeric calculations predict and study the actual structure of space-charge-layers in solid electrolytes. To illustrate these dynamics and validate our model, computational results are presented and compared with experimental observations. Analog to semiconductors, we determine the material dependent, asymmetric space-charge-layer width in the low temperature limit approximately. This allows us to make an explicit statement about the influence of defect concentrations and dielectric properties on the width of the space-charge-layers in homogeneous solid electrolytes.

Bord Kutluay Yüce	Department of Astronomy University of Michigan 1085 S. University Ann Arbor MI 481090-1107		We model the observed precision differential abundance patterns of three G-type dwarfs, assuming a mass of planetary or disk material was added to or subtracted from the atmosphere of the star. The two-parameter model is fit by linear regression. The stellar abundance patterns are corrected for Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). The differential abundances can be highly correlated with the elemental condensation temperature. We show how it is possible to match not only the slope, but the quantitative abundance differences, assuming a composition for the added material equal to that of the bulk earth. We also model the wide pair HIP 34407 and HIP 34426, where GCE corrections are assumed unnecessary. An appendix discusses issues of volatility and condensation temperature.	stars: abundances — sun: abundances — planetary systems: planet-star interactions
[2101.10296] Exploiting Symmetry Reduces the Cost of Training QAOA	Ruslan Shaydulin Stefan M. Wild			A promising approach to the practical application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is finding QAOA parameters classically in simulation and sampling the solutions from QAOA with optimized parameters on a quantum computer. Doing so requires repeated evaluations of QAOA energy in simulation. We propose a novel approach for accelerating the evaluation of QAOA energy by leveraging the symmetry of the problem. We show a connection between classical symmetries of the objective function and the symmetries of the terms of the cost Hamiltonian with respect to the QAOA energy. We show how by considering only the terms that are not connected by symmetry, we can significantly reduce the cost of evaluating the QAOA energy. Our approach is general and applies to any known subgroup of symmetries and is not limited to graph problems. Our results are directly applicable to nonlocal QAOA generalization RQAOA. We outline how available fast graph automorphism solvers can be leveraged for computing the symmetries of the problem in practice. We implement the proposed approach on the MaxCut problem using a state-of-the-art tensor network simulator and a graph automorphism solver on a benchmark of 48 graphs with up to 10,000 nodes. Our approach provides an improvement foronof the graphs considered, with a median speedup of, on a benchmark whereof the graphs are known to be hard for automorphism solvers.	
[2101.10297] Nonequilibrium thermomechanics of Gaussian phase packet crystals: application to the quasistatic quasicontinuum method	Prateek Gupta Michael Ortiz Dennis M. Kochmann		pgupta@ethz.ch dmk@ethz.ch ortiz@aero.caltech.edu	The quasicontinuum(QC)method was originally introduced to bridge across length scalesby coarse-graining an atomistic ensemble to significantly larger continuum scales at zero temperature, thus overcoming the crucial length-scalelimitation of classical atomic-scale simulation techniques while solely relying on atomic-scale input (in the form of interatomic potentials). An associated challenge lies in bridging across time scales to overcome the time-scale limitations of atomisticsat finite temperature. To address the biggest challenge, bridging across both length and time scales, only a few techniques exist, and most of those are limited to conditions of constant temperature. Here, we present a newgeneralstrategy for thespace-time coarseningof an atomistic ensemble, which introduces thermomechanical coupling.Specifically, we evolve the statistics of an atomistic ensemble in phase space over time by applying the Liouville equation to an approximation of the ensemble’s probability distribution (which further admits a variational formulation). To this end, we approximate a crystalline solid as a lattice of lumped correlated Gaussian phase packets occupying atomic lattice sites, and we investigate the resulting quasistatics and dynamics of the system. By definition, phase packets account for the dynamics of crystalline lattices at finite temperature through the statistical variances of atomic momenta and positions. We show that momentum-space correlation allows for an exchange between potential and kinetic contributions to the crystal’s Hamiltonian. Consequently, local adiabatic heating due to atomic site motion is captured. Moreover,in the quasistatic limit,the governing equations reduce to the minimization of thermodynamic potentials(similar to maximum-entropy formulation previously introduced for finite-temperature QC), and they yield the local equation of state, which we derive for isothermal, isobaric, and isentropic conditions. Since our formulation without interatomic correlations precludes irreversible heat transport, we demonstrate its combination with thermal transport models to describe realistic atomic-level processes, and we discuss opportunities for capturing atomic-level thermal transport by including interatomic correlations in the Gaussian phase packet formulation. Overall, our Gaussian phase packet approachoffers a promising avenue for finite-temperature non-equilibrium quasicontinuumtechniques, which may be combined with thermal transport models and extended to other approximations of the probability distribution as well as to exploit the variational structure.

Kivelson	Department of Physics Stanford University Stanford CA 93405		The two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) realized in semiconductor hetero-structures has been the focus of fruitful study for decades. It is, in many ways, the paradigmatic system in the field of highly correlated electrons. The list of discoveries that have emerged from such studies and have opened new fields of physics is extraordinary, including discoveries related to the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, weak localization, metal-insulator transitions, Wigner crystalization, mesoscopic quuantum transport phenomena, etc. Now, a set of recent studies[1,2]on ultra-clean modulation-doped AlAs quantum wells have uncovered a new set of ordering transitions associated with the onset of ferrromagnetism and electron nematicity (or orbital ordering).	
[2101.10300] Channel Estimation via Successive Denoising in MIMO OFDM Systems: A Reinforcement Learning Approach	Myeung Suk Oh1, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour1, Taejoon Kim2, Christopher G. Brinton1 and David J. Love1	1Electrical and Computer Engineering Purdue University West Lafayette IN USA2Electrical Engineering and Computer Science University of Kansas Lawrence KS USA1{oh223 hosseina cgb 	2taejoonkim@ku.edu	In general, reliable communication via multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) requires accurate channel estimation at the receiver. The existing literature largely focuses on denoising methods for channel estimation that depend on either (i) channel analysis in the time-domain with prior channel knowledge or (ii) supervised learning techniques which require large pre-labeled datasets for training. To address these limitations, we present a frequency-domain denoising method based on a reinforcement learning framework that does not need a priori channel knowledge and pre-labeled data. Our methodology includes a new successive channel denoising process based on channel curvature computation, for which we obtain a channel curvature magnitude threshold to identify unreliable channel estimates. Based on this process, we formulate the denoising mechanism as a Markov decision process, where we define the actions through a geometry-based channel estimation update, and the reward function based on a policy that reduces mean squared error (MSE). We then resort to Q-learning to update the channel estimates. Numerical results verify that our denoising algorithm can successfully mitigate noise in channel estimates. In particular, our algorithm provides a significant improvement over the practical least squares (LS) estimation method and provides performance that approaches that of the ideal linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation with perfect knowledge of channel statistics.

[2101.10301] Fractional boundary charges with quantized slopes in interacting one- and two-dimensional systems	Katharina Laubscher Clara S. Weber Dante M. Kennes Mikhail Pletyukhov Herbert Schoeller Daniel Loss Jelena Klinovaja	Department of Physics University of Basel Klingelbergstrasse 82 CH-4056 Basel Switzerland		We study fractional boundary charges (FBCs) for two classes of strongly interacting systems. First, we study strongly interacting nanowires subjected to a periodic potential with a period that is a rational fraction of the Fermi wavelength. For sufficiently strong interactions, the periodic potential leads to the opening of a charge density wave gap at the Fermi level. The FBC then depends linearly on the phase offset of the potential with a quantized slope determined by the period. Furthermore, different possible values for the FBC at a fixed phase offset label different degenerate ground states of the system that cannot be connected adiabatically. Next, we turn to the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at odd filling factors, whereis an integer. For a Corbino disk threaded by an external flux, we find that the FBC depends linearly on the flux with a quantized slope that is determined by the filling factor. Again, the FBC hasdifferent branches that cannot be connected adiabatically, reflecting the-fold degeneracy of the ground state. These results allow for several promising and strikingly simple ways to probe strongly interacting phases via boundary charge measurements.

[2101.10306] Weave Realizability for limit-from𝐷-type	James Hughes			We study exact Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian links of-type in the standard contact 3-sphere. The main result is the existence of a Lagrangian filling, represented by a weave, such that any algebraic quiver mutation of the associated intersection quiver can be realized as a geometric weave mutation. The method of proof is via Legendrian weave calculus and a construction of appropriate 1-cycles whose geometric intersections realize the required algebraic intersection numbers. In particular, we show that in-type, each cluster chart of the moduli of microlocal rank-1 sheaves is induced by at least one embedded exact Lagrangian filling. Hence, the Legendrian links of-type have at least as many Hamiltonian isotopy classes of Lagrangian fillings as cluster seeds in the-type cluster algebra, and their geometric exchange graph for Lagrangian disk surgeries contains the cluster exchange graph of-type.	
[2101.10307] Testing Scalable Bell Inequalities for Quantum Graph States on IBM Quantum Devices	Bo Yang Rudy Raymond Hiroshi Imai Hyungseok Chang Hidefumi Hiraishi	thanks:		Testing and verifying imperfect multi-qubit quantum devices are important as such noisy quantum devices are widely available today. Bell inequalities are known useful for testing and verifying the quality of the quantum devices from their nonlocal quantum states and local measurements. There have been many experiments demonstrating the violations of Bell inequalities but they are limited in the number of qubits and the types of quantum states. We report violations of Bell inequalities on IBM Quantum devices based on the scalable and robust inequalities maximally violated by graph states as proposed by Baccari et al. (Ref.[1]). The violations are obtained from the quantum states of path graphs up to 57 and 21 qubits on the 65-qubit and 27-qubit IBM Quantum devices, respectively, and from those of star graphs up to 8 and 7 qubits with error mitigation on the same devices. We are able to show violations of the inequalities on various graph states by constructing low-depth quantum circuits producing them, and by applying the readout error mitigation technique. We also point out that quantum circuits for star graph states of sizecan be realized with circuits of depthon subdivided honeycomb lattices which are the topology of the 65-qubit IBM Quantum device. Our experiments show encouraging results on the ability of existing quantum devices to prepare entangled quantum states, and provide experimental evidences on the benefit of scalable Bell inequalities for testing them.	
[2101.10308] Detection of Bidirectional System-Environment Information Exchanges	Adrián A. Budini	Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET) Centro Atómico Bariloche Avenida E. Bustillo Km 9.5 (8400) Bariloche Argentina and Universidad Tecnológica Nacional (UTN-FRBA) Fanny Newbery 111 (8400) Bariloche Argentina		Quantum memory effects can be related to a bidirectional exchange of information between an open system and its environment, which in turn modifies the state and dynamical behavior of the last one. Nevertheless, non-Markovianity can also be induced by environments whose dynamics is not affected during the system evolution, implying the absence of any physical information exchange. An unsolved open problem in the formulation of quantum memory measures is the apparent impossibility of discerning between both paradigmatic cases. Here, we present an operational scheme that, based on the outcomes of successive measurements processes performed over the system of interest, allows to distinguishing between both kinds of memory effects. The method accurately detects bidirectional information flows in diverse dissipative and dephasing non-Markovian open system dynamics.

[2101.10314] Ricci de Turck flow on incomplete manifolds	Tobias Marxen Boris Vertman			In this paper we construct a Ricci de Turck flow on any incomplete Riemannian manifold with bounded curvature. The central property of the flow is that it stays uniformly equivalent to the initial incomplete Riemannian metric, and in that sense preserves any given initial singularity structure. Together with the corresponding result by Shi for complete manifolds[Shi89], this gives that any (complete or incomplete) manifold of bounded curvature can be evolved by the Ricci de Turck flow for a short time.

We first revise Rehren’s construction of an initial object in the cathegory of primitive-generated axial algebras giving a formal one, filling some gaps and, though correcting some inaccuracies, confirm Rehren’s results. Then we focus on-generated algebras which naturally part into three cases: the twocriticalcasesand, and thegenericcase (i.e. all the rest). About these cases, which will be dealt in detail in subsequent papers, we give bounds on the dimensions (the generic case already treated by Rehen) and classify all 2-generated primitive axial algebras of Monster typeoverforandalgebraically independent indeterminates over. Finally we restrict to the-generatedMajorana algebras(i.e. whenand), showing that these fall precisely into the nine isomorphism types of the Norton-Sakuma algebras.

[2101.10317] Terminus: A Versatile Simulator for Space-based Telescopes	Billy Edwards Ian Stotesbury	Blue Skies Space Ltd. 69 Wilson Street London EC2A 2BB UKDepartment of Physics and Astronomy University College London Gower Street London WC1E 6BT UK		Space-based telescopes offer unparalleled opportunities for characterising exoplanets, Solar System bodies and stellar objects. However, observatories in low Earth orbits (e.g. Hubble, CHEOPS, Twinkle and an ever increasing number of cubesats) cannot always be continuously pointed at a target due to Earth obscuration. For exoplanet observations consisting of transit, or eclipse, spectroscopy this causes gaps in the light curve, which reduces the information content and can diminish the science return of the observation. Terminus, a time-domain simulator, has been developed to model the occurrence of these gaps to predict the potential impact on future observations. The simulator is capable of radiometrically modelling exoplanet observations as well as producing light curves and spectra. Here, Terminus is baselined on the Twinkle mission but the model can be adapted for any space-based telescope and is especially applicable to those in a low-Earth orbit. Terminus also has the capability to model observations of other targets such as asteroids or brown dwarfs.	
[2101.10318] Multi-Time Attention Networks for Irregularly Sampled Time Series	Satya Narayan Shukla & Benjamin M. MarlinCollege of Information and Computer SciencesUniversity of Massachusetts AmherstAmherst, MA 01003,			Irregular sampling occurs in many time series modeling applications where it presents a significant challenge to standard deep learning models. This work is motivated by the analysis of physiological time series data in electronic health records, which are sparse, irregularly sampled, and multivariate. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework for this setting that we callMulti-Time Attention Networks. Multi-Time Attention Networks learn an embedding of continuous time values and use an attention mechanism to produce a fixed-length representation of a time series containing a variable number of observations. We investigate the performance of this framework on interpolation and classification tasks using multiple datasets. Our results show that the proposed approach performs as well or better than a range of baseline and recently proposed models while offering significantly faster training times than current state-of-the-art methods.111Implementation available at :https://github.com/reml-lab/mTAN

Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recently proposed as an innovative new technology to achieve energy efficiency and coverage enhancement by establishing favorable signal propagation environments, thereby improving data transmission in massive connectivity. Nevertheless, the BS needs to detect active devices and estimate channels to support data transmission in RIS-assisted massive access systems, which yields unique challenges. This paper shall consider an RIS-assisted uplink IoT network and aims to solve theRIS-related activity detection and channel estimationproblem, where the BS detects the active devices and estimates the separated channels of the RIS-to-device link and the RIS-to-BS link. Due to limited scattering between the RIS and the BS, we model the RIS-to-BS channel as a sparse channel. As a result, by simultaneously exploiting both the sparsity of sporadic transmission in massive connectivity and the RIS-to-BS channels, we formulate the RIS-related activity detection and channel estimation problem as a sparse matrix factorization problem. Furthermore, we develop an approximate message passing (AMP) based algorithm to solve the problem based on Bayesian inference framework and reduce the computational complexity by approximating the algorithm with the central limit theorem and Taylor series arguments. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and improvements of the proposed algorithm.

Nobukawa Hironori Matsumoto	Department of Physics Graduate School of Science Tokyo Metropolitan University 1-1 Minami-Osawa Hachioji-shi Tokyo 192-0397 Japan		We report the discovery of diffuse X-ray emission around the supernova remnant (SNR) G106.3+2.7, which is associated with VER J2227+608 and HAWC J2227+610 and is known as a candidate for a PeV cosmic-ray accelerator (PeVatron). We analyze observational data of Suzaku around the SNR and the adjacent pulsar PSR J2229+6114. We find diffuse X-ray emission that is represented by either thermal or nonthermal processes. However, the metal abundance for the thermal emission is, which may be too small in the Milky Way and suggests that the emission is nonthermal. The intensity of the diffuse emission increases toward PSR J2229+6114 in the same way as radio emission, and it is in contrast with gamma-ray emission concentrated on a molecular cloud. The X-ray photon index does not change with the distance from the pulsar and it indicates that radiative cooling is ineffective and particle diffusion is not extremely slow. The X-ray and radio emissions seem to be of leptonic origin and the parent electrons may originate from the pulsar. The gamma-ray emission appears to be of hadronic origin because of its spatial distribution. The parent protons may be tightly confined in the cloud separately from the diffusing electrons.

This is explicitly shown via the calculation of the axion-pion thermalization rate at the next-to-leading order in chiral perturbation theory. We finally advocate a strategy for a sound extraction of the axion HDM bound via lattice QCD techniques.	
[2101.10331] Multi-angle reconstruction of domain morphology with all-optical diamond magnetometry	Lucio Stefan Anthony K. C. Tan Baptiste Vindolet Michael Högen Dickson Thian Hang Khume Tan Loïc Rondin Helena S. Knowles Jean-François Roch Anjan Soumyanarayanan Mete Atatüre	thanks:	ma424@cam.ac.uk lucio.stefan@nbi.ku.dk	Scanning diamond magnetometers based on the optically detected magnetic resonance of the nitrogen-vacancy centre offer very high sensitivity and non-invasive imaging capabilities when the stray fields emanating from ultrathin magnetic materials are sufficiently low (). Beyond this low-field regime, the optical signal quenches and a quantitative measurement is challenging. While the field-dependent NV photoluminescence can still provide qualitative information on magnetic morphology, this operation regime remains unexplored particularly for surface magnetisation larger than. Here, we introduce a multi-angle reconstruction technique (MARe) that captures the full nanoscale domain morphology in all magnetic-field regimes leading to NV photoluminescence quench. To demonstrate this, we use [Ir/Co/Pt]multilayer films with surface magnetisation an order of magnitude larger than previous reports. Our approach brings non-invasive nanoscale magnetic field imaging capability to the study of a wider pool of magnetic materials and phenomena.	
[2101.10332] Emergent moments in a Hund’s impurity	Victor Drouin-Touchette Elio J. König Yashar Komijani Piers Coleman	Center for Materials Theory Rutgers University Piscataway New Jersey 08854 USA		Motivated by the relevance of Hund’s coupling in the context of multiorbital superconductors, we revisit the problem of a multiorbital Kondo impurity with Hund’s interaction. Using dynamical large-N techniques, we propose an efficient approach that retains the essential physics at play, while providing a pathway to scalable quantum impurity solvers. We are able to follow the ground state, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties of this system over many decades of temperature. Our approach captures the emergence of large moments, and follows the stretched evolution of the physics down to their exponentially suppressed Kondo temperature. We focus our analysis on the intermediate finite temperature phase which presents an alternate paramagnetic state due to the emergent moment, and discuss the relevance of this regime to Hund’s metals.	
[2101.10333] Radial Gradients in Dust-to-Gas Ratio Lead to Preferred Region for Giant Planet Formation	Yayaati Chachan Eve J. Lee Heather A. Knutson	Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences California Institute of Technology 1200 E California Blvd Pasadena CA 91125 USA		The Rosseland mean opacity of dust in protoplanetary disks is often calculated assuming the interstellar medium (ISM) size distribution and a constant dust-to-gas ratio. However, the dust size distribution and the dust-to-gas ratio in protoplanetary disks are distinct from those of the ISM. Here, we use simple dust evolution models that incorporate grain growth and transport to calculate the time evolution of mean opacity of dust grains as a function of distance from the star. Dust dynamics and size distribution are sensitive to the assumed value of the turbulence strengthand the velocity at which grains fragment. For moderate-to-low turbulence strengths ofand substantial differences infor icy and ice-free grains, we find a spatially non-uniform dust-to-gas ratio and grain size distribution that deviate significantly from the ISM values, in agreement with previous studies. The effect of a non-uniform dust-to-gas ratio on the Rosseland mean opacity dominates over that of the size distribution. This spatially varying—that is non-monotonic—dust-to-gas ratio creates a region in the protoplanetary disk that is optimal for producing hydrogen-rich planets, potentially explaining the apparent peak in gas giant planet occurrence rate at intermediate distances. The enhanced dust-to-gas ratio within the ice line also suppresses gas accretion rates onto sub-Neptune cores, thus stifling their tendency to undergo runaway gas accretion within disk lifetimes. Finally, our work corroborates the idea that low mass cores with large primordial gaseous envelopes (‘super-puffs’) originate beyond the ice line.	
[2101.10334] A No-Lose Theorem for Discovering the New Physics of (𝑔-2)_𝜇 at Muon Colliders	Rodolfo Capdevilla David Curtin Yonatan Kahn Gordan Krnjaic	institutetext:	dcurtin@physics.utoronto.ca rcapdevilla@perimeterinstitute.ca krnjaicg@fnal.gov yfkahn@illinois.edu	We perform a model-exhaustive analysis of all possible beyond Standard Model (BSM) solutions to theanomaly to study production of the associated new states at future muon colliders, and formulate a no-lose theorem for the discovery of new physics if the anomaly is confirmed and weakly coupled solutions below the GeV scale are excluded. Our goal is to find the highest possible mass scale of new physics subject only to perturbative unitarity, and optionally the requirements of minimum flavour violation (MFV) and/or naturalness. We prove that a 3 TeV muon collider is guaranteed to discover all BSM scenarios in whichis generated by SM singlets with masses above; lighter singlets will be discovered by upcoming low-energy experiments. If new states with electroweak quantum numbers contribute to, the minimal requirements of perturbative unitarity guarantee new charged states below, but this is strongly disfavoured by stringent constraints on charged lepton flavour violating (CLFV) decays. Reasonable BSM theories that satisfy CLFV bounds by obeying Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV) and avoid generating two new hierarchy problems require the existence of at least one new charged state below. This strongly motivates the construction of high-energy muon colliders, which are guaranteed to discover new physics: either by producing these new charged states directly, or by setting a strong lower bound on their mass, which would empirically prove that the universe is fine-tuned and violates the assumptions of MFV while somehow not generating large CLFVs. The former case is obviously the desired outcome, but the latter scenario would perhaps teach us even more about the universe by profoundly revising our understanding of naturalness, cosmological vacuum selection, and the SM flavour puzzle.

[2101.10336] Randomness of Möbius coefficents and Brownian Motion: Growth of the Mertens Function and the Riemann Hypothesis	Giuseppe Mussardo André LeClair	SISSA and INFN Sezione di Trieste via Bonomea 265 I-34136 Trieste Italy		The validity of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) on the location of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann-function is directly related to the growth of the Mertens function, whereis the Möbius coefficient of the integer: the RH is indeed true if the Mertens function goes asymptotically as, whereis an arbitrary strictly positive quantity. We argue that this behavior can be established on the basis of a new probabilistic approach based on theglobalproperties of Mertens function, namely, based on reorganizing globally in distinct blocks the terms of its series. To this aim, we focus the attention on the square-free numbers and we derive a series of probabilistic results concerning the prime number distribution along the series of square-free numbers, the average number of prime divisors, the Erdős-Kac theorem for square-free numbers, etc. These results point to the conclusion that the Mertens function is subject to a normal distribution as much as any other random walk. We also present an argument in favor of the thesis that the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis also implies the validity of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for the Dirichlet-functions. Next we study thelocalproperties of the Mertens function, i.e. its variation induced by each Möbius coefficient restricted to the square-free numbers. Motivated by the natural curiosity to see how close to a purely random walk is any sub-sequence extracted by the sequence of the Möbius coefficients for the square-free numbers, we perform a massive statistical analysis on these coefficients, applying to them a series of randomness tests of increasing precision and complexity: together with several frequency tests within a block, the list of our tests include those for the longest run of ones in a block, the binary matrix rank test, the Discrete Fourier Transform test, the non-overlapping template matching test, the entropy test, the cumulative sum test, the random excursion tests, etc. for a total number of eighteen different tests. The successful outputs of all these tests (each of them with a level of confidence ofthat all the sub-sequences analyzed are indeed random) can be seen as impressive “experimental” confirmations of the brownian nature of the restricted Möbius coefficients and the probabilistic normal law distribution of the Mertens function analytically established earlier. In view of the theoretical probabilistic argument and the large battery of statistical tests, we can conclude that while a violation of the RH is strictly speaking not impossible, it is however extremely improbable.	
[2101.10337] Extracting Dark-Matter Velocities from Halo Masses: A Reconstruction Conjecture	Keith R. Dienes Fei Huang Jeff Kost Kevin Manogue Brooks Thomas	of Physics University of Arizona Tucson AZ 85721 USADepartment of Physics University of Maryland College Park MD 20742 USA	huangf4@uci.edu thomasbd@lafayette.edu J.D.Kost@sussex.ac.uk manoguek@lafayette.edu dienes@email.arizona.edu	Increasing attention has recently focused on non-traditional dark-matter production mechanisms which result in primordial dark-matter velocity distributions with highly non-thermal shapes. In this paper, we undertake an assessment of how the detailed shape of a general dark-matter velocity distribution impacts structure formation in the non-linear regime. In particular, we investigate the impact on the halo-mass and subhalo-mass functions, as well as on astrophysical observables such as satellite and cluster-number counts. We find that many of the standard expectations no longer hold in situations in which this velocity distribution takes a highly non-trivial, even multi-modal shape. For example, we find that the nominal free-streaming scale alone becomes insufficient to characterize the effect of free-streaming on structure formation. In addition, we propose a simple one-line conjecture which can be used to “reconstruct” the primordial dark-matter velocity distribution directly from the shape of the halo-mass function. Although our conjecture is completely heuristic, we show that it successfully reproduces the salient features of the underlying dark-matter velocity distribution even for non-trivial distributions which are highly non-thermal and/or multi-modal, such as might occur for non-minimal dark sectors. Moreover, since our approach relies only on the halo-mass function, our conjecture provides a method of probing dark-matter properties even for scenarios in which the dark and visible sectors interact only gravitationally.

Feng Sebastian Trojanowski	Particle Physics Astrophysics and Cosmology Center Department of Physics and Astronomy University of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh PA 15217 USA	batell@pitt.edu strojanowski@camk.edu.pl jlf@uci.edu	New light particles may be produced in large numbers in the far-forward region at the LHC and then decay to dark matter, which can be detected through its scattering in far-forward experiments. We consider the example of invisibly-decaying dark photons, which decay to dark matter through. The dark matter may then be detected through its scattering off electrons. We consider the discovery potential of detectors placed on the beam collision axis 480 m from the ATLAS interaction point, including an emulsion detector (FASER2) and, for the first time, a Forward Liquid Argon Experiment (FLArE). For each of these detector technologies, we devise cuts that effectively separate the singlesignal from the leading neutrino- and muon-induced backgrounds. We find that 10- to 100-tonne detectors may detect hundreds to thousands of dark matter events in the HL-LHC era and will sensitively probe the thermal relic region of parameter space. These results motivate the construction of far-forward emulsion and liquid argon detectors at the LHC, as well as a suitable location to accommodate them, such as the proposed Forward Physics Facility.	
[2101.10339] The Cosmology of Quadratic Torsionful Gravity	Damianos Iosifidis, Lucrezia Ravera	Institute of Theoretical Physics Department of Physics Aristotle University of Thessaloniki 54124 Thessaloniki Greece.DISAT Politecnico di Torino Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24 10129 Torino Italy.INFN Sezione di Torino Via P. Giuria 1 10125 Torino 	lucrezia.ravera@polito.it 20lucrezia.ravera@polito.it diosifid@auth.gr	We study the cosmology of a quadratic metric-compatible torsionful gravity theory in the presence of a perfect hyperfluid. The gravitational action is an extension of the Einstein-Cartan theory given by the usual Einstein-Hilbert contribution plus all the admitted quadratic parity even torsion scalars and the matter action also exhibits a dependence on the connection. The equations of motion are obtained by regarding the metric and the metric-compatible torsionful connection as independent variables. We then consider a Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker background, analyze the conservation laws, and derive the torsion modified Friedmann equations for our theory. Remarkably, we are able to provide exact analytic solutions for the torsionful cosmology.

We explore the possibility that life may have arisen early because the higher CMB temperature would have supplied the requisite energy for the existence of different solvents on the surfaces of objects. At redshifts of, after the first stars are predicted to have formed, a number of molecules (but not water) might have existed in liquid form over intervals ofMyr toMyr. We delineate the challenges and prospects for life in the high-redshift Universe, and assess the various candidates for alternative biochemistries in this context – of the options considered herein, we conclude that ethane is probably the most promising contender.

We consider discrete 1-form symmetries, which can be either part of the generalized concept “categorical symmetry” (labelled as) introduced recently, or an explicit1-form symmetry. We demonstrate that for many quantum phase transitions involving aorsymmetry, the following expectation valuetakes the form, whereis an operator defined associated with loop(or its interior), which reduces to the Wilson loop operator for cases with an explicit1-form symmetry.is the perimeter of, and theterm arises from the sharp corners of the loop, which is consistent with recent numerics on a particular example.is a universal microscopic-independent number, which inis related to the universal conductivity at the quantum phase transition.can be computed exactly for certain transitions using the dualities betweenconformal field theories developed in recent years.

[2101.10343] Where binary neutron stars merge: predictions from IllustrisTNG	Jonah C. Rose Paul Torrey K.H. Lee I. Bartos	Department of Astronomy University of Florida Gainesville FL 32611 USA		The rate and location of Binary Neutron Star (BNS) mergers are determined by a combination of the star formation history and the Delay Time Distribution (DTD) function. In this paper, we couple the star formation rate histories (SFRHs) from the IllustrisTNG model to a series of varied assumptions for the BNS DTD to make predictions for the BNS merger host galaxy mass function. These predictions offer two outcomes: (i) in the near term: influence BNS merger event follow-up strategy by scrutinizing where most BNS merger events are expected to occur and (ii) in the long term: constrain the DTD for BNS merger events once the host galaxy mass function is observationally well determined. From our fiducial model analysis, we predict that 50% of BNS mergers will occur in host galaxies with stellar mass between, 68% between, and 95% between. We find that the details of the DTD employed does not have a strong effect on the peak of the host mass function. However, varying the DTD provides enough spread that the true DTD can be determined from enough electromagnetic observations of BNS mergers. Knowing the true DTD can help us determine the prevalence of BNS systems formed through highly eccentric and short separation fast-merging channels and can constrain the dominant source of r-process material.	neutron star merger | gravitational waves | methods: numerical | stars: neutron | binaries: close
[2101.10344] A simple model for mixing and cooling in cloud-wind interactions	Matthew W. Abruzzo Greg L. Bryan Drummond B. Fielding	Department of Astronomy Columbia University New York NY 10027 USA		We introduce a simple entropy-based formalism to characterize the role of mixing in pressure-balanced multiphase clouds, and demonstrate example applications usingenzo-e(magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Under this formalism, the high-dimensional description of the system’s state at a given time is simplified to the joint distribution of mass over pressure () and entropy (). As a result, this approach provides a way for (empirically and analytically) quantifying the impact of different initial conditions and sets of physics on the system evolution. We find that mixing predominantly alters the distribution along thedirection and illustrate how the formalism can be used to model mixing and cooling for fluid elements originating in the cloud. We further confirm and generalize a previously suggested criterion for cloud growth in the presence of radiative cooling, and demonstrate that the shape of the cooling curve, particularly at the low temperature end, can play an important role in controlling condensation. Moreover, we discuss the capacity of our approach to generalize such a criterion to apply to additional sets of physics, and to build intuition for the impact of subtle higher order effects not directly addressed by the criterion.

Vitello	institutetext:	dane.kleiner@inaf.it	We present MeerKAT neutral hydrogen (Hi) observations of the Fornax A group, which is likely falling into the Fornax cluster for the first time. Our Hiimage is sensitive to 1.410atoms cmover 44.1 km s, where we detect Hiin 10 galaxies and a total of (1.120.02)10Mof Hiin the intra-group medium (IGM). We search for signs of pre-processing in the 12 group galaxies with confirmed optical redshifts that reside within the sensitivity limit of our Hiimage. There are 9 galaxies that show evidence of pre-processing and we classify each galaxy into their respective pre-processing category, according to their Himorphology and gas (atomic and molecular) scaling relations. Galaxies that have not yet experienced pre-processing have extended Hidiscs and a high Hicontent with a H-to-Hiratio that is an order of magnitude lower than the median for their stellar mass. Galaxies that are currently being pre-processed display Hitails, truncated Hidiscs with typical gas fractions, and H-to-Hiratios. Galaxies in the advanced stages of pre-processing are the most Hideficient. If there is any Hi, they have lost their outer Hidisc and efficiently converted their Hito H, resulting in H-to-Hiratios that are an order of magnitude higher than the median for their stellar mass. The central, massive galaxy in our group (NGC 1316) underwent a 10:1 merger2 Gyr ago and ejected 6.6 – 11.210Mof Hi, which we detect as clouds and streams in the IGM, some of which form coherent structures up to220 kpc in length. We also detect giant (100 kpc) ionised hydrogen (H) filaments in the IGM, likely from cool gas being removed (and subsequently ionised) from an in-falling satellite. The Hfilaments are situated within the hot halo of NGC 1316 and there are localised regions that contain Hi. We speculate that the Hand multiphase gas is supported by magnetic pressure (possibly assisted by the NGC 1316 AGN), such that the hot gas can condense and form Hithat survives in the hot halo for cosmological timescales.

[2101.10348] Heavy elements unveil the non primordial origin of the giant HI ring in Leo	Edvige Corbelli Giovanni Cresci Filippo Mannucci David Thilker Giacomo Venturi	INAF-Osservatorio di Arcetri Largo E. Fermi 5 50125 Firenze Italy		The origin and fate of the most extended extragalactic neutral cloud known in the Local Universe, the Leo ring, is still debated 38 years after its discovery. Its existence is alternatively attributed to leftover primordial gas with some low level of metal pollution versus enriched gas stripped during a galaxy-galaxy encounter. Taking advantage of MUSE (Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) operating at the VLT, we performed optical integral field spectroscopy of 3 HI clumps in the Leo ring where ultraviolet continuum emission has been found. We detected, for the first time, ionized hydrogen in the ring and identify 4 nebular regions powered by massive stars. These nebulae show several metal lines ([OIII], [NII], [SII]) which allowed reliable measures of metallicities, found to be close to or above the solar value (0.81.4). Given the faintness of the diffuse stellar counterparts, less than 3of the observed heavy elements could have been produced locally in the main body of the ring and not much more than 15in the HI clump towards M 96. This inference, and the chemical homogeneity among the regions, convincingly demonstrates that the gas in the ring is not primordial, but has been pre-enriched in a galaxy disk, then later removed and shaped by tidal forces and it is forming a sparse population of stars.

In particular, the challenges arise regarding i) the origin of an anomalous global symmetry called a PQ symmetry, ii) the scale of the PQ symmetry breaking, and iii) the quality of the PQ symmetry. In this letter, we provide a natural and simple UV completed model that addresses these challenges. Extra quarks and anti-quarks are separated by two branes in the Randall-Sundrumspacetime while a hidden SU() gauge field condensates in the bulk. The brane separation is the origin of the PQ symmetry and its breaking scale is given by the dynamical scale of the SU() gauge interaction. The (generalized) Casimir force of SU() condensation stabilizes the 5th dimension, which guarantees the quality of the PQ symmetry.

[2101.10352] FIRE RISK ANALYSIS BY USING SENTINEL-2 DATA: THE CASE STUDY OF THE VESUVIUS IN CAMPANIA, ITALY				As sadly known, forest fires are part of a set of natural disasters that have always affected regions of the world typically characterized by a tropical climate with long periods of drought. However, due to climate changes of the recent years, other regions of our planet that were not affected by this plague have also had to deal with this phenomenon. One of them is certainly the Italian peninsula, and especially the regions of southern Italy. For this reason, the scientific community, and in particular that one of the remote sensing, plays an important role in the development of reliable techniques to provide useful support to the competent authorities. Therefore, in this work, the capability of the Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI), derived from spaceborne remote sensing (RS) data, is assessed to monitor the forest fires occurred on a specific study area during the summer of 2017: the volcano Vesuvius, near Naples (in Campania, Italy). In particular, the index is obtained from Sentinel-2 multispectral images of the European Space Agency (ESA), which are free of charge and open accessible. Moreover, the twin Sentinel-2 (S-2) sensors allows to overcome some restrictions on time delivery and high frequency observation. These requirements are goodly matched by other spaceborne sensors, such as MODIS and VIIRS satellites, but at the expense of a lower spatial resolution.	
[2101.10353] DeepDT: Learning Geometry From Delaunay Triangulation for Surface Reconstruction	Yiming Luo222Equal contribution., Zhenxing Mi222Equal contribution., Wenbing Tao111Corresponding author.			In this paper, a novel learning-based network, named DeepDT, is proposed to reconstruct the surface from Delaunay triangulation of point cloud. DeepDT learns to predict inside/outside labels of Delaunay tetrahedrons directly from a point cloud and corresponding Delaunay triangulation. The local geometry features are first extracted from the input point cloud and aggregated into a graph deriving from the Delaunay triangulation. Then a graph filtering is applied on the aggregated features in order to add structural regularization to the label prediction of tetrahedrons. Due to the complicated spatial relations between tetrahedrons and the triangles, it is impossible to directly generate ground truth labels of tetrahedrons from ground truth surface. Therefore, we propose a multi-label supervision strategy which votes for the label of a tetrahedron with labels of sampling locations inside it. The proposed DeepDT can maintain abundant geometry details without generating overly complex surfaces , especially for inner surfaces of open scenes. Meanwhile, the generalization ability and time consumption of the proposed method is acceptable and competitive compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DeepDT.	
[2101.10354] On factorized overlaps: Algebraic Bethe Ansatz, twists, and Separation of Variables	Tamás Gombor, Balázs Pozsgay			We investigate the exact overlaps between eigenstates of integrable spin chains and a special class of states called “integrable initial/final states”. These states satisfy a special integrability constraint, and they are closely related to integrable boundary conditions. We derive new algebraic relations for the integrable states, which lead to a set of recursion relations for the exact overlaps. We solve these recursion relations and thus we derive new overlap formulas, valid in the XXX Heisenberg chain and its integrable higher spin generalizations. Afterwards we generalize the integrability condition to twisted boundary conditions, and derive the corresponding exact overlaps. Finally, we embed the integrable states into the “Separation of Variables” framework, and derive an alternative representation for the exact overlaps of the XXX chain. Our derivations and proofs are rigorous, and they can form the basis of future investigations involving more complicated models such as nested or long-range deformed systems.	
[2101.10355] A local baseline of the black hole mass scaling relations for active galaxies. IV. Correlations between 𝑀_BH and host galaxy 𝜎, stellar mass, and luminosity.	Vardha N. Bennert Tommaso Treu Xuheng Ding Isak Stomberg Simon Birrer Tomas Snyder Matthew A. Malkan Andrew W. Stephens Matthew W. Auger	Physics Department California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo CA 93407 USA		The tight correlations between the mass of supermassive black holes () and their host-galaxy properties have been of great interest to the astrophysical community, but a clear understanding of their origin and fundamental drivers still eludes us. The local relations for active galaxies are interesting in their own right and form the foundation for any evolutionary study over cosmic time. We present Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging of a sample of 66 local active galactic nuclei (AGNs); for 14 objects, we also obtained Gemini near-infrared images. We use state of the art methods to perform surface photometry of the AGN host galaxies, decomposing them in spheroid, disk and bar (when present) and inferring the luminosity and stellar mass of the components. We combine this information with spatially-resolved kinematics obtained at the Keck Telescopes to study the correlations between(determined from single-epoch virial estimators) and host galaxy properties. The correlations are uniformly tight for our AGN sample, with intrinsic scatterdex, smaller than or equal to that of quiescent galaxies. We find no difference between pseudo and classical bulges or barred and non-barred galaxies. We show that all the tight correlations can be simultaneously satisfied by AGN hosts in the 10-10regime, with data of sufficient quality. The-relation is also in agreement with that of AGNs withobtained from reverberation mapping, providing an indirect validation of single-epoch virial estimators of.	accretion | accretion disksblack hole physicsgalaxies: activegalaxies: evolutiongalaxies: Seyfert

Classical filter designs, such as(i.e., Kalman) and, minimize the average and worst-case estimation errors, respectively. As a resultfilters are sensitive to inaccuracies in the underlying statistical model, andfilters are overly conservative since they safeguard against the worst-case scenario. We propose instead to minimize theregretin order to design filters that perform well in different noise regimes by comparing their performance with that of a clairvoyant filter. More explicitly, we minimize the largest deviation of the squared estimation error of a causal filter from that of a non-causal filter that has access to future observations. In this sense, the regret-optimal filter will have the best competitive performance with respect to the non-causal benchmark filter no matter what the true signal and the observation process are. For the important case of signals that can be described with a time-invariant state-space, we provide an explicit construction for the regret optimal filter in the estimation (causal) and the prediction (strictly-causal) regimes. These solutions are obtained by reducing the regret filtering problem to a Nehari problem, i.e., approximating a non-causal operator by a causal one in spectral norm. The regret-optimal filters bear some resemblance to Kalman andfilters: they are expressed as state-space models, inherit the finite dimension of the original state-space, and their solutions require solving algebraic Riccati equations.Numerical simulations demonstrate that regret minimization inherently interpolates between the performances of theandfilters and is thus a viable approach for filter design.	
[2101.10358] Scaling of disorder operator at (2+1)⁢𝑑 U(1) quantum criticality	Yan-Cheng Wang Meng Cheng Zi Yang Meng	School of Materials Science and Physics China University of Mining and Technology Xuzhou 221116 China	zymeng@hku.hk m.cheng@yale.edu	We study disorder operator, defined as a symmetry transformation applied to a finite region, across a continuous quantum phase transition in. We show analytically that at a conformally-invariant critical point with U(1) symmetry, the disorder operator with a small U(1) rotation angle defined on a rectangle region exhibits power-law scaling with the perimeter of the rectangle. The exponent is proportional to the current central charge of the critical theory. Such a universal scaling behavior is due to the sharp corners of the region and we further obtain a general formula for the exponent when the corner is nearly smooth. To probe the full parameter regime, we carry out systematic computation of the U(1) disorder parameter in the square lattice Bose-Hubbard model across the superfluid-insulator transition with large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and confirm the presence of the universal corner correction. The exponent of the corner term determined from numerical simulations agrees well with the analytical predictions.	
[2101.10359] A Benchmark Model for Fixed-Target Arctic Sea Ice Forecasting	Francis X. DieboldUniversity of Pennsylvania Maximilian GöbelUniversity of Lisbon		fdiebold@sas.upenn.edu	Abstract: We propose a reduced-form benchmark predictive model (BPM) for fixed-target forecasting of Arctic sea ice extent, and we provide a case study of its real-time performance for target date September 2020. We visually detail the evolution of the statistically-optimal point, interval, and density forecasts as time passes, new information arrives, and the end of September approaches. Comparison to the BPM may prove useful for evaluating and selecting among various more sophisticated dynamical sea ice models, which are widely used to quantify the likely future evolution of Arctic conditions and their two-way interaction with economic activity.

By resorting to convolutional neural networks that can fully discover the underlying pattern of the map, we propose a novel way of constraining dark matter annihilation based on the Planck 2018 data. We demonstrate that the trained neural network can efficiently predict the likelihood and accurately place bounds on the annihilation cross-section in amodel-independentfashion. The machinery will be made public in the near future.

The results are achieved via a generalization of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional construction presented recently for homogeneous systems with standard dilation. Along with the classical approach for the calculation of the estimates within the Lyapunov-Krasovskii framework, we develop a novel approach which combines the use of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals with ideas of the Razumikhin framework. More precisely, a lower bound for the functional on a special set of functions inspired by the Razumikhin condition is constructed, and an additional condition imposed on the solution of the comparison equation ensures that this bound can be used to estimate all solutions in a certain neighbourhood of the trivial one. An example shows that this approach yields less conservative estimates in comparison with the classical one.

The designers of these algorithms aimed to promote values such as transparency, equity, and community in the process. However, school districts have encountered practical challenges in their deployment. In fact, San Francisco Unified School District voted to stop using and completely redesign their student assignment algorithm because it was frustrating for families and it was not promoting educational equity in practice. We analyze this system using a Value Sensitive Design approach and find that one reason values are not met in practice is that the system relies on modeling assumptions about families’ priorities, constraints, and goals that clash with the real world. These assumptions overlook the complex barriers to ideal participation that many families face, particularly because of socioeconomic inequalities. We argue that direct, ongoing engagement with stakeholders is central to aligning algorithmic values with real world conditions. In doing so we must broaden how we evaluate algorithms while recognizing the limitations of purely algorithmic solutions in addressing complex socio-political problems.	student assignment | mechanism design | value sensitive design

Such shared representations are typically learned in isolation, either across tasks or across languages. In this work, we propose a meta-learning approach to learn the interactions between both tasks and languages. We also investigate the role of different sampling strategies used during meta-learning. We present experiments on five different tasks and six different languages from the XTREME multilingual benchmark datasetHu et al.(2020). Our meta-learned model clearly improves in performance compared to competitive baseline models that also include multi-task baselines. We also present zero-shot evaluations on unseen target languages to demonstrate the utility of our proposed model.

For a sample of five nearby grand design spirals located on the Main Sequence (MS) of star forming galaxies, we exploit maps at 500 pc resolution of stellar mass and star formation rate (and SFR). For the same cells, we also have estimates of the neutral () and molecular () gas masses. To compute the redshift evolution we exploit two relations:i)one between the molecular-to-neutral mass ratio and the total gas mass (), whose scatter shows a strong dependence with the distance from the spatially resolved MS, andii)the one betweenand. For both methods, we find that/within the optical radius slightly decreases with redshift, contrary to common expectations of galaxies becoming progressively more dominated by molecular hydrogen at high redshifts. We discuss possible implications of this trend on our understanding of the internal working of high redshift galaxies.	galaxies: evolution – galaxies: star formation – galaxies: spirals

[2101.10375] An Updated Formalism For Line-Driven Radiative Acceleration and Implications for Stellar Mass Loss	Aylecia S. Lattimer Steven R. Cranmer	Department of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics University of Colorado Boulder CO 80309 USA		Radiation contributes to the acceleration of large-scale flows in various astrophysical environments because of the strong opacity in spectral lines. Quantification of the associated force is crucial to understanding these line-driven flows, and a large number of lines (due to the full set of elements and ionization stages) must be taken into account. Here we provide new calculations of the dimensionless line strengths and associated opacity-dependent force multipliers for an updated list of approximately 4.5 million spectral lines compiled from the NIST, CHIANTI, CMFGEN, and TOPbase databases. To maintain generality of application to different environments, we assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, illumination by a Planck function, and the Sobolev approximation. We compute the line forces in a two-dimensional grid of temperatures (i.e., values between 5,200 and 70,000 K) and densities (varying over 11 orders of magnitude). Historically, the force multiplier function has been described by a power-law function of optical depth. We revisit this assumption by fitting alternative functions that include a saturation to a constant value (Gayley’sparameter) in the optically-thin limit. This alternate form is a better fit than the power-law form, and we use it to calculate example mass-loss rates for massive main-sequence stars. Because the power-law force multiplier does not continue to arbitrarily small optical depths, we find a sharp decrease, or quenching, of line-driven winds for stars with effective temperatures less than about 15,000 K.

This paper proposes a learning-based falsification framework for testing the implementation of an automated or self-driving function in simulation. We assume that the function specification is associated with a violation metric on possible scenarios. Prior knowledge is incorporated to limit the scenario parameter variance and in a model-based falsifier to guide and improve the learning process. For an exemplary adaptive cruise controller, the presented framework yields non-trivial falsifying scenarios with higher reward, compared to scenarios obtained by purely learning-based or purely model-based falsification approaches.

We identify the groups with the unsupervised clustering algorithm, Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN), which previously identified twelve new stellar substructures in the Orion complex. For each of the two groups, we derive the 3D space motions of individual stars usingGaiaEDR3 proper motions supplemented by radial velocities fromGaiaDR2, APOGEE-2, and GALAH DR3. We present evidence for radial expansion of the two groups from a common center. Unlike previous work, our study suggests that evidence of stellar group expansion is confined only to OBP-near and Briceño-1, whereas the rest of the groups in the complex show more complicated motions. Interestingly, the stars in the two groups lie at the center of a dust shell, as revealed via an extant 3D dust map. The exact mechanism that produces such coherent motions remains unclear, while the observed radial expansion and dust shell suggest that massive stellar feedback could have influenced the star formation history of these groups.

Jensen	of PhysicsUniversity of Northern British Columbia 3333 University Way Prince George B.C. Canada V2N 4Z9	ejensen@unbc.ca	The mechanisms for photodissociation of methyl halides (CHX, X= Cl, Br, I) have been studied for these molecules when adsorbed on thin films of CHor CFon copper single crystals, using time-of-flight spectroscopy with 248nm and 193nm light. For CHCl and CHBr monolayers adsorbed on CH, two photodissociation pathways can be identified– neutral photodissociation similar to the gas-phase, and a dissociative electron attachment (DEA) pathway due to photoelectrons from the metal. The same methyl halides adsorbed on a CFthin film display only neutral photodissociation, with the DEA pathway entirely absent due to intermolecular quenching via a LUMO-derived electronic band in the CFthin film. For CHI adsorbed on a CFthin film, illumination with 248nm light results in CHphotofragments departing due to neutral photodissociation via the A-band absorption. When CHI monolayers on CHthin films are illuminated at the same wavelength, additional new photodissociation pathways are observed that are due to absorption in the molecular film with energy transfer leading to dissociation of the CHI molecules adsorbed on top. The proposed mechanism for this photodissociation is via a charge-transfer complex for the CHlayer and adsorbed CHI.

The views expressed here are those of the authors and do not reflect those of INEGI.Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía	franciscoj.corona@inegi.org.mx	In this paper, we present a new approach based on dynamic factor models (DFMs) to perform nowcasts for the percentage annual variation of the Mexican Global Economic Activity Indicator (IGAE in Spanish). The procedure consists of the following steps: i) build a timely and correlated database by using economic and financial time series and real-time variables such as social mobility and significant topics extracted by Google Trends; ii) estimate the common factors using the two-step methodology ofDoz et al., (2011); iii) use the common factors in univariate time-series models for test data; and iv) according to the best results obtained in the previous step, combine the statistically equal better nowcasts (Diebold-Mariano test) to generate the current nowcasts. We obtain timely and accurate nowcasts for the IGAE, including those for the current phase of drastic drops in the economy related to COVID-19 sanitary measures. Additionally, the approach allows us to disentangle the key variables in the DFM by estimating the confidence interval for both the factor loadings and the factor estimates. This approach can be used in official statistics to obtain preliminary estimates for IGAE up to 50 days before the official results.

Logic locking is a type of hardware obfuscation technique where additional key gates are inserted into the circuit. Only the correct key can unlock the functionality of that circuit otherwise the system produces the wrong output. In an effort to hinder these threats on ICs, we have developed a probability-based logic locking technique to protect the design of a circuit. Our proposed technique called “ProbLock” can be applied to combinational and sequential circuits through a critical selection process. We used a filtering process to select the best location of key gates based on various constraints. Each step in the filtering process generates a subset of nodes for each constraint. We also analyzed the correlation between each constraint and adjusted the strength of the constraints before inserting key gates. We have tested our algorithm on 40 benchmarks from the ISCAS ’85 and ISCAS ’89 suite.

[2101.10390] Introducing a Central African Primate Vocalisation Dataset for Automated Species Classification				Automated classification of animal vocalisations is a potentially powerful wildlife monitoring tool. Training robust classifiers requires sizable annotated datasets, which are not easily recorded in the wild. To circumvent this problem, we recorded four primate species under semi-natural conditions in a wildlife sanctuary in Cameroon with the objective to train a classifier capable of detecting species in the wild. Here, we introduce the collected dataset, describe our approach and initial results of classifier development. To increase the efficiency of the annotation process, we condensed the recordings with an energy/change based automatic vocalisation detection. Segmenting the annotated chunks into training, validation and test sets, initial results reveal up to 82% unweighted average recall (UAR) test set performance in four-class primate species classification.

In a harsh remote collaboration setting, data compression techniques such as autoencoder can be utilized to obtain and transmit the data in terms of latent variables in a compact form. In addition, to ensure real-time runtime performance even under unstable environments, an anytime estimation approach is desired that can reconstruct the full contents from incomplete information. In this context, we propose a method for imputation of latent variables whose elements are partially lost. To achieve the anytime property with only a few dimensions of variables, exploiting prior information of the category-level is essential. A prior distribution used in variational autoencoders is simply assumed to be isotropic Gaussian regardless of the labels of each training datapoint. This type of flattened prior makes it difficult to perform imputation from the category-level distributions. We overcome this limitation by exploiting a category-specific multi-modal prior distribution in the latent space. The missing elements of the partially transferred data can be sampled, by finding a specific modal according to the remaining elements. Since the method is designed to use partial elements for anytime estimation, it can also be applied for data over-compression. Based on the experiments on the ModelNet and Pascal3D datasets, the proposed approach shows consistently superior performance over autoencoder and variational autoencoder up to 70% data loss.

Cherry Avenue Tucson AZ 85721 USAEarths in Other Solar Systems Team NASA Nexus for Exoplanet System Science		Next-generation space observatories will conduct the first systematic surveys of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres and search for evidence of life beyond Earth. While in-depth observations of the nearest habitable worlds may yield enticing results, there are fundamental questions about planetary habitability and evolution which can only be answered through population-level studies of dozens to hundreds of terrestrial planets. To determine the requirements for next-generation observatories to address these questions, we have developedBioverse.Bioversecombines existing knowledge of exoplanet statistics with a survey simulation and hypothesis testing framework to determine whether proposed space-based direct imaging and transit spectroscopy surveys will be capable of detecting various hypothetical statistical relationships between the properties of terrestrial exoplanets. Following a description of the code, we applyBioverseto determine whether an ambitious direct imaging or transit survey would be able to determine the extent of the circumstellar habitable zone and study the evolution of Earth-like planets. Given recent evidence that Earth-sized habitable zone planets are likely much rarer than previously believed(Pascucci et al.,2019), we find that space missions with large search volumes will be necessary to study the population of terrestrial and habitable worlds. Moving forward,Bioverseprovides a methodology for performing trade studies of future observatory concepts to maximize their ability to address population-level questions, including and beyond the specific examples explored here.

[2101.10395] Representations of closed quadratic forms associated with Stieltjes and inverse Stieltjes holomorphic families of linear relations	Yu.M. Arlinskiĭ S. Hassi	Stuttgart 	yury.arlinskii@gmail.com sha@uwasa.fi	In this paper holomorphic families of linear relations which belong to the Stieltjes or inverse Stieltjes class are studied. It is shown that in their domain of holomorphythe values of Stieltjes and inverse Stieltjes families are, up to a rotation, maximal sectorial. This leads to a study of the associated closed sesquilinear forms and their representations. In particular, it is shown that the Stieltjes and inverse Stieltjes holomorphic families of linear relations are of type (B) in the sense of Kato. These results are proved by using linear fractional transforms which connect these families to holomorphic functions that belong to a combined Nevanlinna-Schur class and a key tool then relies on a specific structure of contractive operators.

[2101.10396] Quality Assessment of Super-Resolved Omnidirectional Image Quality Using Tangential Views	Cagri Ozcinarand Aakanksha RanaSamsung R&D, UK, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA			Omnidirectional images (ODIs), also known as 360-degree images, enable viewers to explore all directions of a given 360-degree scene from a fixed point. Designing an immersive imaging system with ODI is challenging as such systems require very large resolution coverage of the entire 360 viewing space to provide an enhanced quality of experience (QoE). Despite remarkable progress on single image super-resolution (SISR) methods with deep-learning techniques, no study for quality assessments of super-resolved ODIs exists to analyze the quality of such SISR techniques. This paper proposes an objective, full-reference quality assessment framework which studies quality measurement for ODIs generated by GAN-based and CNN-based SISR methods. The quality assessment framework offers to utilize tangential views to cope with the spherical nature of a given ODIs. The generated tangential views are distortion-free and can be efficiently scaled to high-resolution spherical data for SISR quality measurement. We extensively evaluate two state-of-the-art SISR methods using widely used full-reference SISR quality metrics adapted to our designed framework. In addition, our study reveals that most objective metric show high performance over CNN based SISR, while subjective tests favors GAN-based architectures.

Our proof uses Grothendieck’s limit theorem for sheaf cohomology and Zariski–Riemann spaces. As an application, we extend Boutot’s theorem to the case of locally quasi-excellent-algebras by showing that ifis a cyclically pure homomorphism of locally quasi-excellent-algebras, andhas rational singularities, thenhas rational singularities. This solves a conjecture of Boutot and answers a question of Schoutens in the locally quasi-excellent case.

The aim is to determine the minimal cost set of additional pipes and gas compressors that can be added to the network to provide the additional capacity to service future loads. This combinatorial optimization problem is initially formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program, which we then extend to account for the variability that is inherent to the demands of gas-fired electricity production and uncertainty in expected future loads. We consider here steady-state flow modeling while ensuring that the solution is feasible for all possible values of interval uncertainty in loads, which results in a challenging semi-infinite problem. We apply previously derived monotonicity properties that enable simplification of the problem to require constraint satisfaction in the two extremal scenarios only, and then formulate the robust gas pipeline network expansion planning problem using a mixed-integer second order cone formulation. We consider case studies on the Belgian network test case to examine the performance of the proposed approach.	
[2101.10399] Anchor Distance for 3D Multi-Object Distance Estimation from 2D Single Shot	Hyeonwoo Yu and Jean Oh	Hyeonwoo Yu and Jean Oh are with the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh PA 15213 		Visual perception of the objects in a 3D environment is a key to successful performance in autonomous driving and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In this paper, we present a real time approach for estimating the distances to multiple objects in a scene using only a single-shot image. Given a 2D Bounding Box (BBox) and object parameters, a 3D distance to the object can be calculated directly using 3D reprojection; however, such methods are prone to significant errors because an error from the 2D detection can be amplified in 3D. In addition, it is also challenging to apply such methods to a real-time system due to the computational burden. In the case of the traditional multi-object detection methods, existing works have been developed for specific tasks such as object segmentation or 2D BBox regression. These methods introduce the concept of anchor BBox for elaborate 2D BBox estimation, and predictors are specialized and trained for specific 2D BBoxes. In order to estimate the distances to the 3D objects from a single 2D image, we introduce the notion ofanchor distancebased on an object’s location and propose a method that applies the anchor distance to the multi-object detector structure. We let the predictors catch the distance prior using anchor distance and train the network based on the distance. The predictors can be characterized to the objects located in a specific distance range. By propagating the distance prior using a distance anchor to the predictors, it is feasible to perform the precise distance estimation and real-time execution simultaneously. The proposed method achieves about 30 FPS speed, and shows the lowest RMSE compared to the existing methods.

[2101.10402] A metric for evaluating 3D reconstruction and mapping performance with no ground truthing				It is not easy when evaluating 3D mapping performance because existing metrics require ground truth data that can only be collected with special instruments. In this paper, we propose a metric, dense map posterior (DMP), for this evaluation. It can work without any ground truth data. Instead, it calculates a comparable value, reflecting a map posterior probability, from dense point cloud observations. In our experiments, the proposed DMP is benchmarked against ground truth-based metrics. Results show that DMP can provide a similar evaluation capability. The proposed metric makes evaluating different methods more flexible and opens many new possibilities, such as self-supervised methods and more available datasets.

One of the key requirements for this to happen is safely managing the air traffic in these urban airspaces. Due to the expected density of the airspace, this requires fast autonomous solutions that can be deployed online. We propose Learning-‘N-Flying (LNF) a multi-UAS Collision Avoidance (CA) framework. It is decentralized, works on-the-fly and allows autonomousUASmanaged by different operators to safely carry out complex missions, represented using Signal Temporal Logic, in a shared airspace. We initially formulate the problem of predictive collision avoidance for twoUASas a mixed-integer linear program, and show that it is intractable to solve online. Instead, we first develop Learning-to-Fly (L2F) by combining: a) learning-based decision-making, and b) decentralized convex optimization-based control. LNF extends L2F to cases where there are more than twoUASon a collision path. Through extensive simulations, we show that our method can run online (computation time in the order of milliseconds), and under certain assumptions has failure rates of less thanin the worst-case, improving to nearin more relaxed operations. We show the applicability of our scheme to a wide variety of settings through multiple case studies.

Emails: {b00066555 smukhopadhyay 		This paper develops and implements an algorithm to compute sequences of polytopic Robust Forward Invariant Sets (RFIS) that can parametrically vary in size between the maximal and minimal RFIS of a nonlinear dynamical system. This is done through a novel computational approach that geometrically deforms a polytope into an invariant set using a sequence of homeomorphishms, based on an invariance condition that only needs to be satisfied at a finite set of test points. For achieving this, a fast computational test is developed to establish if a given polytopic set is an RFIS. The geometric nature of the proposed approach makes it applicable for arbitrary Lipschitz continuous nonlinear systems in the presence of bounded additive disturbances. The versatility of the proposed approach is presented through simulation results on a variety of nonlinear dynamical systems in two and three dimensions, for which, sequences of invariant sets are computed.

[2101.10409] On the Higher Loop Euler-Heisenberg Trans-Series Structure	Gerald V. Dunne and Zachary HarrisDepartment of Physics, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269-3046, USA			We show that the one-loop Euler-Heisenberg QED effective Lagrangian in a constant background field acquires a very different non-perturbative trans-series structure at two-loop and higher-loop order in the fine structure constant. Beyond one-loop, virtual particles interact, causing fluctuations about the instantons, whereby the simple poles of the one-loop Borel transform become branch points. We illustrate this in detail at two-loop order using Ritus’s seminal result for the renormalized two-loop effective Lagrangian as an exact double-integral representation, and propose a possible new approach to computations at higher loop order. Our methods yield remarkably accurate extrapolations from weak-field to strong-field, and from magnetic to electric background field, at both one-loop and two-loop order, based on surprisingly little perturbative input.

Both a spin-flop and a spin-flip transitions to less than 1/Ce are observed at 2 K below 30 kOe in the(Haandb) and 4.3 kOe (H) data, respectively, indicating a four-fold symmetry of thealong the principal directions in the tetragonalab-plane withset of easy directions. However, anomalously robust and complex two-fold symmetry is observed in the angular dependence of resistivity and magnetic torque data in the magnetically ordered state once the field is swept in theab-plane. This two-fold symmetry is independent of temperature- and field-hystereses and suggests a magnetic phase transition that separates two different magnetic structures in theab-plane. The boundary of this magnetic phase transition can be tuned by different growth conditions.

[2101.10413] HIV viral load and the efficacy of antiviral drug	Stephanie Yunfei Zhang and Mesfin Asfaw Taye	West Los Angeles College Science Division9000 Overland Ave Culver City CA 90230 USA		Developing antiviral drugs is an exigent task since viruses mutate to overcome the effect of antiviral drugs. As a result, the efficacy of most antiviral drugs is short-lived. To include this effect, we modify the Neumann and Dahari model. Considering the fact that the efficacy of the antiviral drug varies in time, the differential equations introduced in the previous model systems are rewritten to study the correlation between the viral load and antiviral drug. The effect of antiviral drug that either prevents infection or stops the production of a virus is explored. First, the efficacy of the drug is considered to decreases monotonously as time progresses. In this case, our result depicts that when the efficacy of the drug is low, the viral load decreases and increases back in time revealing the effect of the antiviral drugs is short-lived. On the other hand, for the antiviral drug with high efficacy, the viral load, as well as the number of infected cells, monotonously decreases while the number of uninfected cells increases. The dependence of the critical drug efficacy on time is also explored. Moreover, the correlation between viral load, the antiviral drug, and CTL response is also explored. In this case, not only the dependence for the basic reproduction ratio on the model parameters is explored but also we analyze the critical drug efficacy as a function of time. We show that the term related to the basic reproduction ratio increases when the CTL response step up. A simple analytically solvable mathematical model is also presented to analyze the correlation between viral load and antiviral drugs.	pacs:Valid PACS appear here

[2101.10418] Fibonacci turbulence	Natalia Vladimirova, Michal Shavitand Gregory Falkovich	Weizmann Institute of Science Rehovot 76100 IsraelBrown University Providence RI 02912 USA		Never is the difference between thermal equilibrium and turbulence so dramatic, as when a quadratic invariant makes the equilibrium statistics exactly Gaussian with independently fluctuating modes. That happens in two very different yet deeply connected classes of systems: incompressible hydrodynamics and resonantly interacting waves. This work presents the first detailed information-theoretic analysis of turbulence in such strongly interacting systems. The analysis involves both energy and entropy and elucidates the fundamental roles of space and time in setting the cascade direction and the changes of the statistics along it. We introduce a beautifully simple yet rich family of discrete models with triplet interactions of neighboring modes and show that it has quadratic conservation laws defined by the Fibonacci numbers. Depending on how the interaction time changes with the mode number, three types of turbulence were found: single direct cascade, double cascade, and the first ever case of a single inverse cascade. We describe quantitatively how deviation from thermal equilibrium all the way to turbulent cascades makes statistics increasingly non-Gaussian and find the self-similar form of the one-mode probability distribution. We reveal where the information (entropy deficit) is encoded and disentangle the communication channels between modes, as quantified by the mutual information in pairs and the interaction information inside triplets.

One of the key challenges of continual learning is to avoid catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., forgetting old tasks in the presence of more recent tasks.

However, the packet collision probability of platoon communication, especially in the out-of-coverage area, is significantly impacted by the random selection algorithm employed in the current resource allocation scheme. In this paper, we first analyze the collision probability via the random selection algorithm based on the current standard. Subsequently, we investigate the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that decreases the collision probability by letting the agent (platoon leader) learn from the communication environment. Monte Carlo simulation is utilized to verify the results obtained in the analytical model and to compare the results between the two discussed algorithms. Numerical results show that the proposed DRL algorithm outperforms the random selection algorithm in terms of different vehicle density, which at least lowering the collision probability by 73% and 45% in low and high vehicle density respectively.

[2101.10427] Finding hidden-feature depending laws inside a data set and classifying it using Neural Network.	Thilo Moshagen Nihal Acharya Adde Ajay Navilarekal Rajgopal			The logcosh loss function for neural networks has been developed to combine the advantage of the absolute error loss function of not overweighting outliers with the advantage of the mean square error of continuous derivative near the mean, which makes the last phase of learning easier. It is clear, and one experiences it soon, that in the case of clustered data, an artificial neural network with logcosh loss learns the bigger cluster rather than the mean of the two. Even more so, the ANN, when used for regression of a set-valued function, will learn a value close to one of the choices, in other words, one branch of the set-valued function, while a mean-square-error NN will learn the value in between. This work suggests a method that uses artificial neural networks with logcosh loss to find the branches of set-valued mappings in parameter-outcome sample sets and classifies the samples according to those branches.

In this work, we consider the unique challenges of developing a unifying test and evaluation framework for complex ensembles of cyber-physical systems with embedded artificial intelligence. We propose a framework that incorporates test and evaluation throughout not only the development life cycle, but continues into operation as the system learns and adapts in a noisy, changing, and contended environment. The framework accounts for the challenges of testing the integration of diverse systems at various hierarchical scales of composition while respecting that testing time and resources are limited. A generic use case is provided for illustrative purposes and research directions emerging as a result of exploring the use case via the framework are suggested.	systems engineering | statistical models | software engineering | artificial intelligence | design of experiments | combinatorial interaction testing
[2101.10431] Optimal Disclosure of Information to Privately Informed Agents	Ozan Candogan Philipp Strack			We study information design when there are multiple agents interacting in a game who are privately informed about their types. Each agent’s utility depends onallagents’ types and actions, as well as (linearly) on the state. The optimal mechanism asks agents to report their types and then sends a private action recommendation to each agent which depends on all reported types and the state. We show that there always exists an optimal mechanism which is laminar partitional. Such a mechanism partitions the state space for each type profile and recommends the same action profile for states that belong to the same partition element. Furthermore, the convex hulls of any two partition elements are such that either one contains the other or they have an empty intersection. In the single-agent case, each state is either perfectly revealed or lies in an interval in which the number of different signal realizations is at most the number of different types of the agent plus two. A similar result is established for the multi-agent case.

Dalvit	Los Alamos National Laboratory Los Alamos NM 87545 USA	dalvit@lanl.gov	Metasurfaces are a key photonic platform to manipulate classical light using sub-wavelength structures with designer optical response. Static metasurfaces have recently entered the realm of quantum photonics, showing their ability to tailor nonclassical states of light. We introduce the concept of space-time quantum metasurfaces for dynamical control of quantum light. We provide illustrative examples of the impact of spatio-temporally modulated metasurfaces in quantum photonics, including the creation of frequency-spin-path hyperentanglement on a single photon and the realization of space-time asymmetry at the deepest level of the quantum vacuum. Photonic platforms based on the space-time quantum metasurface concept have the potential to enable novel functionalities, such as on-demand entanglement generation for quantum communications, nonreciprocal photon propagation for free-space quantum isolation, and reconfigurable quantum imaging and sensing.	
[2101.10434] The Symmetry Basis of Pattern Formation in Reaction-Diffusion Networks	Ian Hunter Michael M. Norton Bolun Chen Chris Simonetti Maria Eleni Moustaka Jonathan Touboul Seth Fraden	thanks:	fraden@brandeis.edu	In networks of nonlinear oscillators, symmetries place hard constraints on the system that can be exploited to predict universal dynamical features and steady-states, providing a rare generic organizing principle for far-from-equilibrium systems. However, the robustness of this class of theories to symmetry-disrupting imperfections is untested. Here, we develop a model experimental reaction-diffusion network of chemical oscillators to test applications of this theory in the context of self-organizing systems relevant to biology and soft robotics. The network is a ring of 4 identical microreactors containing the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction coupled to nearest neighbors via diffusion. Assuming perfect symmetry, theory predicts 4 categories of stable spatiotemporal phase-locked periodic states and 4 categories of invariant manifolds that guide and structure transitions between phase-locked states. In our experiments, we observed the predicted symmetry-derived synchronous clustered transients that occur when the dynamical trajectories coincide with invariant manifolds. However, we observe only 3 of the 4 phase-locked states that are predicted for the idealized homogeneous system. Quantitative agreement between experiment and numerical simulations is found by accounting for the small amount of experimentally determined heterogeneity. This work demonstrates that a surprising degree of the network’s dynamics are constrained by symmetry in spite of the breakdown of the assumption of homogeneity and raises the question of why heterogeneity destabilizes some symmetry predicted states, but not others.

Accurate state estimation in Li-S batteries is urgently needed for safe and efficient operation. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, electrochemical model-based observers have not been reported for Li-S batteries, primarily due to the complex dynamics that make state observer design a challenging problem. In this work, we demonstrate a state estimation scheme based on a zero-dimensional electrochemical model for Li-S batteries. The nonlinear differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model is incorporated into an extend Kalman filter. This observer design estimates both differential and algebraic states that represent the dynamic behavior inside the cell, from voltage and current measurements only. The effectiveness of the proposed estimation algorithm is illustrated by numerical simulation results. Our study unlocks how an electrochemical model can be utilized for practical state estimation of Li-S batteries.	
[2101.10437] High-fidelity Prediction of Megapixel Longitudinal Phase-space Images of Electron Beams using Encoder-Decoder Neural Networks	J. Zhu, Y. Chen, F. Brinker, W. Decking, S. Tomin, H. Schlarb	Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY Notkestrasse 85 22607 Hamburg Germany		Modeling of large-scale research facilities is extremely challenging due to complex physical processes and engineering problems. Here, we adopt a data-driven approach to model the longitudinal phase-space diagnostic beamline at the photoinector of the European XFEL with an encoder-decoder neural network model. A deep convolutional neural network (decoder) is used to build images measured on the screen from a small feature map generated by another neural network (encoder). We demonstrate that the model trained only with experimental data can make high-fidelity predictions of megapixel images for the longitudinal phase-space measurement without any prior knowledge of photoinjectors and electron beams. The prediction significantly outperforms existing methods. We also show the scalability and interpretability of the model by sharing the same decoder with more than one encoder used for different setups of the photoinjector, and propose a pragmatic way to model a facility with various diagnostics and working points. This opens the door to a new way of accurately modeling a photoinjector using neural networks and experimental data. The approach can possibly be extended to the whole accelerator and even other types of scientific facilities.	
[2101.10438] Persistent Covering of a Graph under Latency and Energy Constraints	Jyh-Ming Lien, Sam Rodriguez, and Marco Morales			Most consumer-level low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have limited battery power and long charging time. Due to these energy constraints, they cannot accomplish many practical tasks, such as monitoring a sport or political event for hours. The problem of providing the service to cover an area for an extended time is known as persistent covering in the literature. In the past, researchers have proposed various hardware platforms, such as battery-swapping mechanisms, to provide persistent covering. However, algorithmic approaches are limited mostly due to the computational complexity and intractability of the problem. Approximation algorithms have been considered to segment a large area into smaller cells that require periodic visits under the latency constraints. However, these methods assume unlimited energy. In this paper, we explore geometric and topological properties that allow us to significantly reduce the size of the optimization problem. Consequently, the proposed method can efficiently determine the minimum number of UAVs needed and schedule their routes to cover an area persistently. We demonstrated experimentally that the proposed algorithm has better performance than the baseline methods.	
[2101.10439] A continuum and computational framework for viscoelastodynamics: finite deformation linear models	Ju Liu Marcos Latorre Alison L. Marsden		marcos.latorre@yale.edu liujuy@gmail.com liuj36@sustech.edu.cn amarsden@stanford.edu	This work concerns the continuum basis and numerical formulation for deformable materials with viscous dissipative mechanisms. We derive a viscohyperelastic modeling framework based on fundamental thermomechanical principles. Since most large deformation problems exhibit isochoric properties, our modeling work is constructed based on the Gibbs free energy in order to develop a continuum theory using pressure-primitive variables, which is known to be well-behaved in the incompressible limit. A set of general evolution equations for the internal state variables is derived. With that, we focus on a family of free energies that leads to the so-called finite deformation linear model. Our derivation elucidates the origin of the evolution equations of that model, which was originally proposed heuristically and thus lacked formal compatibility with the underlying thermodynamics. In our derivation, the thermodynamic inconsistency is clarified and rectified. A classical model based on the identical polymer chain assumption is revisited and is found to have non-vanishing viscous stresses in the equilibrium limit, which is counter-intuitive in the physical sense. Because of that, we then discuss the relaxation property of the non-equilibrium stress in the thermodynamic equilibrium limit and its implication on the form of free energy. A modified version of the identical polymer chain model is then proposed, with a special case being the model proposed by G. Holzapfel and J. Simo. Based on the consistent modeling framework, a provably energy stable numerical scheme is constructed for incompressible viscohyperelasticity using inf-sup stable elements. In particular, we adopt a suite of smooth generalization of the Taylor-Hood element based on Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) for spatial discretization. The temporal discretization is performed via the generalized-scheme. We present a suite of numerical results to corroborate the proposed numerical properties, including the nonlinear stability, robustness under large deformation, and the stress accuracy resolved by the higher-order elements. Additionally, the pathological behavior of the original identical polymer chain model is numerically identified with an unbounded energy decaying. This again underlines the importance of demanding vanishing non-equilibrium stress in the equilibrium limit.

BhattIndian Institute of Information Technology		jignesh.bhatt@iiitvadodara.ac.in cs20resch11007@iith.ac.in	With the substantial performance of neural networks in sensitive fields increases the need for interpretable deep learning models. Major challenge is to uncover the multiscale and distributed representation hidden inside the basket mappings of the deep neural networks. Researchers have been trying to comprehend it through visual analysis of features, mathematical structures, or other data-driven approaches. Here, we work on implementation invariances of CNN-based representations and present an analytical binary prototype that provides useful insights for large scale real-life applications. We begin by unfolding conventional CNN and then repack it with a more transparent representation. Inspired by the attainment of neural networks, we choose to present our findings as a three-layer model. First is a representation layer that encompasses both the class information (group invariant) and symmetric transformations (group equivariant) of input images. Through these transformations, we decrease intra-class distance and increase the inter-class distance. It is then passed through a dimension reduction layer followed by a classifier. The proposed representation is compared with the equivariance of AlexNet (CNN) internal representation for better dissemination of simulation results. We foresee following immediate advantages of this toy version: i) contributes pre-processing of data to increase the feature or class separability in large scale problems, ii) helps designing neural architecture to improve the classification performance in multi-class problems, and iii) helps building interpretable CNN through scalable functional blocks.

It is widely used in the real-world applications including autonomous driving, medical imaging analysis, industrial inspection, smartphone camera for person segmentation and so on. Accelerating the semantic segmentation models on the mobile and edge devices are practical needs for the industry. Recent years have witnessed the wide availability of CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) accelerators. They have the advantages on power efficiency, inference speed, which are ideal for accelerating the semantic segmentation models on the edge devices. However, the CNN accelerator chips also have the limitations on flexibility and memory. In addition, the CPU load is very critical because the CNN accelerator chip works as a co-processor with a host CPU. In this paper, we optimize the semantic segmentation model in order to fully utilize the limited memory and the supported operators on the CNN accelerator chips, and at the same time reduce the CPU load of the CNN model to zero. The resulting model is called GnetSeg. Furthermore, we propose the integer encoding for the mask of the GnetSeg model, which minimizes the latency of data transfer between the CNN accelerator and the host CPU. The experimental result shows that the model running on the 224mW chip achieves the speed of 318FPS with excellent accuracy for applications such as person segmentation.

Thus, changes in the livestock behavior are a critical indicator for early detection and prevention of several diseases. Rumination behavior is a significant variable for tracking the development and yield of animal husbandry. Therefore, various monitoring methods and measurement equipment have been used to assess cattle behavior. However, these modern attached devices are invasive, stressful and uncomfortable for the cattle and can influence negatively the welfare and diurnal behavior of the animal. Multiple research efforts addressed the problem of rumination detection by adopting new methods by relying on visual features. However, they only use few postures of the dairy cow to recognize the rumination or feeding behavior. In this study, we introduce an innovative monitoring method using Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based deep learning models. The classification process is conducted under two main labels: ruminating and other, using all cow postures captured by the monitoring camera. Our proposed system is simple and easy-to-use which is able to capture long-term dynamics using a compacted representation of a video in a single 2D image. This method proved efficiency in recognizing the rumination behavior with 95%, 98% and 98% of average accuracy, recall and precision, respectively.

Chemical transport during uphill diffusion causes phase separation, that is, spinodal decomposition. Thus, to describe the coarsening kinetics of the exsolution microstructure, we derive a thermodynamically consistent continuum theory for the multicomponent Cahn–Hilliard equations while accounting for multiple chemical reactions and neglecting deformations. Our approach considers multiple balances of microforces augmented by multiple constituent content balance equations within an extended Larché–Cahn framework. As for the Larché–Cahn framework, we incorporate into the theory the Larché–Cahn derivatives with respect to the phase fields and their gradients. We also explain the implications of the resulting constrained gradients of the phase fields in the form of the gradient energy coefficients. Moreover, we derive a configurational balance that includes all the associated configurational fields in agreement with the Larché–Cahn framework. We study phase separation in a three-component system whose microstructural evolution depends upon the reaction-diffusion interactions and to analyze the underlying configurational fields. This simulation portrays the interleaving between the reaction and diffusion processes and how the configurational tractions drive the motion of interfaces.

Kim who can be reached at This work was supported in part by the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) via grant RP 20-03.	seungmokim@georgiasouthern.edu	Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications amass research interest in recent days because of its ability to schedule multiple access more efficiently as compared to its predecessor technology, i.e., dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). However, the foremost issue still remains: a vehicle needs to keep the V2X performance in a highly dynamic environment. This paper proposes a way to exploit the dynamicity. That is, we propose a resource allocation mechanism adaptive to the environment, which can be an efficient solution for air interface congestion that a V2X network often suffers from. Specifically, the proposed mechanism aims at granting a higher chance of transmission to a vehicle with a higher crash risk. As such, the channel access is prioritized to those with urgent needs. The adaptation is implemented based on reinforcement learning (RL). We model the RL framework as a contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB), which provides efficiency as well as accuracy. We highlight the most superb aspect of the proposed mechanism: it is designed to be operated at a vehicle autonomously without need for any assistance from a central entity. Henceforth, the proposed framework is expected to make a particular fit to distributed V2X network such as C-V2X mode 4.

These methods at one time performed well on tasks such as word sense induction (WSI), but they have since been overtaken by task-specific techniques which exploit contextualized embeddings. However, sense embeddings and contextualization need not be mutually exclusive. We introduce PolyLM, a method which formulates the task of learning sense embeddings as a language modeling problem, allowing contextualization techniques to be applied. PolyLM is based on two underlying assumptions about word senses: firstly, that the probability of a word occurring in a given context is equal to the sum of the probabilities of its individual senses occurring; and secondly, that for a given occurrence of a word, one of its senses tends to be much more plausible in the context than the others. We evaluate PolyLM on WSI, showing that it performs considerably better than previous sense embedding techniques, and matches the current state-of-the-art specialized WSI method despite having six times fewer parameters. Code and pre-trained models are available athttps://github.com/AlanAnsell/PolyLM.	
[2101.10449] Towards Domain Invariant Single Image Dehazing	Pranjay Shyam1Kuk-Jin Yoon2Kyung-soo Kim1			Presence of haze in images obscures underlying information, which is undesirable in applications requiring accurate environment information. To recover such an image, a dehazing algorithm should localize and recover affected regions while ensuring consistency between recovered and its neighboring regions. However owing to fixed receptive field of convolutional kernels and non uniform haze distribution, assuring consistency between regions is difficult. In this paper, we utilize an encoder-decoder based network architecture to perform the task of dehazing and integrate an spatially aware channel attention mechanism to enhance features of interest beyond the receptive field of traditional conventional kernels. To ensure performance consistency across diverse range of haze densities, we utilize greedy localized data augmentation mechanism. Synthetic datasets are typically used to ensure a large amount of paired training samples, however the methodology to generate such samples introduces a gap between them and real images while accounting for only uniform haze distribution and overlooking more realistic scenario of non-uniform haze distribution resulting in inferior dehazing performance when evaluated on real datasets. Despite this, the abundance of paired samples within synthetic datasets cannot be ignored. Thus to ensure performance consistency across diverse datasets, we train the proposed network within an adversarial prior-guided framework that relies on a generated image along with its low and high frequency components to determine if properties of dehazed images matches those of ground truth. We preform extensive experiments to validate the dehazing and domain invariance performance of proposed framework across diverse domains and report state-of-the-art (SoTA) results.

But in time, these small cell licensed spectrum is not sufficient to satisfy future applications like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Hence, cellular operators look for alternate unlicensed spectrum in Wi-Fi 5 GHz band, later 3GPP named as LTE Licensed Assisted Access (LAA). The recent and current roll-out of LAA deployments (in developed nations like the US) provides an opportunity to understand coexistence’s profound ground truth. This paper discusses a high-level overview of my past, present, and future research works in the direction of small cell benefits. In the future, we shift the focus onto the latest unlicensed band: 6 GHz, where the latest Wi-Fi version, 802.11ax, will coexist with the latest cellular technology, 5G New Radio (NR) in unlicensed.

Single image depth estimation has improved drastically in recent years due to the development of DNNs. However, vulnerabilities of DNNs for image classification have been revealed by adversarial attacks, and DNNs for monocular depth estimation could contain similar vulnerabilities. Therefore, research on vulnerabilities of DNNs for monocular depth estimation has spread rapidly, but many of them assume white-box conditions where inside information of DNNs is available, or are transferability-based black-box attacks that require a substitute DNN model and a training dataset. Utilizing Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization, the proposed method in this paper analyzes DNNs under the black-box condition where only output depth maps are available. In addition, the proposed method does not require a substitute DNN that has a similar architecture to the target DNN nor any knowledge about training data used to train the target model. Experimental results showed that the proposed method succeeded in attacking two DNN-based methods that were trained with indoor and outdoor scenes respectively.

Getting optimal network coverage is one of those challenging issues that need to be examined critically before any network setup. Optimal network coverage not only minimizes the consumption of limited energy of battery-driven sensors but also reduce the sensing of redundant information. In this paper, we focus on nature-inspired optimization algorithms concerning the optimal coverage in WSNs. In the first half of the paper, we have briefly discussed the taxonomy of the optimization algorithms along with the problem domains in WSNs. In the second half of the paper, we have compared the performance of two nature-inspired algorithms for getting optimal coverage in WSNs. The first one is a combined Improved Genetic Algorithm and Binary Ant Colony Algorithm (IGA-BACA), and the second one is Lion Optimization (LO). The simulation results confirm that LO gives better network coverage, and the convergence rate of LO is faster than that of IGA-BACA. Further, we observed that the optimal coverage is achieved at a lesser number of generations in LO as compared to IGA-BACA. This review will help researchers to explore the applications in this field as well as beyond this area.	Optimal Coverage | Bio-inspired Algorithm | Lion Optimization | WSNs.

From this we deduce that the cyclic subgroups of limit groups over coherent RAAGs are separable, answering a question of Casals-Ruiz, Duncan and Kazachov. We also discuss relations between free products with commuting subgroups and the word problem, and recover the fact that limit groups over coherent RAAGs and toral relatively hyperbolic groups have a solvable word problem.	
[2101.10459] General Method for Classicality Certification in the Prepare and Measure Scenario	Carlos de Gois George Moreno Ranieri Nery Samuraí Brito Rafael Chaves Rafael Rabelo	Instituto de Física “Gleb Wataghin” Universidade Estadual de Campinas CEP 13083-859 Campinas Brazil		Preparation and measurement of physical systems are the operational building blocks of any physical experiment, and to describe them is the first purpose of any physical theory. It is remarkable that, in some situations, even when only preparation and measurement devices of a single system are present and they are uncharacterized, it is possible to distinguish between the behaviours of quantum and classical systems relying only on observational data. Certifying the physical origin of measurement statistics in the prepare and measure scenario is of primal importance for developing quantum networks, distributing quantum keys and certifying randomness, to mention a few applications, but, surprisingly, no general methods to do so are known. We progress on this problem by crafting a general, sufficient condition to certify that a given set of preparations can only generate classical statistics, for any number of generalized measurements. As an application, we employ the method to demonstrate non-classicality activation in the prepare and measure scenario, also considering its application in random access codes. Following that, we adapt our method to certify, again through a sufficient condition, whether a given set of measurements can never give rise to non-classical behaviors, irrespective of what preparations they may act upon. This, in turn, allows us to find a large set of incompatible measurements that cannot be used to demonstrate non-classicality, thus showing incompatibility is not sufficient for non-classicality in the prepare and measure scenario.	
[2101.10460] Temporal Latent Auto-Encoder: A Method for Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Forecasting	Nam Nguyen111Nam Nguyen and Brian Quanz contributed equally to this work, Brian Quanz11footnotemark:1	footnotemark:		Probabilistic forecasting of high dimensional multivariate time series is a notoriously challenging task, both in terms of computational burden and distribution modeling. Most previous work either makes simple distribution assumptions or abandons modeling cross-series correlations. A promising line of work exploits scalable matrix factorization for latent-space forecasting, but is limited to linear embeddings, unable to model distributions, and not trainable end-to-end when using deep learning forecasting. We introduce a novel temporal latent auto-encoder method which enables nonlinear factorization of multivariate time series, learned end-to-end with a temporal deep learning latent space forecast model. By imposing a probabilistic latent space model, complex distributions of the input series are modeled via the decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on many popular multivariate datasets, with gains sometimes as high asfor several standard metrics.

An important result is that given any monomial ideal, the function taking a real number to the corresponding real power ofis a step function which is left continuous and has rational discontinuity points.

[2101.10463] RTGPU: Real-Time GPU Scheduling of Hard Deadline Parallel Tasks with Fine-Grain Utilization	An Zou, Jing Li, Christopher D. Gill, and Xuan Zhang	An Zou Christopher D. Gill and Xuan Zhang are with Washington University in St. Louis St. Louis MO 63130. Jing Li is with the Department of Computer Science New Jersey Institute of Technology Newark NJ 07102.Manuscript received April 19 2005; revised August 26 2015.		Many emerging cyber-physical systems, such as autonomous vehicles and robots, rely heavily on artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to perform important system operations. Since these highly parallel applications are computationally intensive, they need to be accelerated by graphics processing units (GPUs) to meet stringent timing constraints. However, despite the wide adoption of GPUs, efficiently scheduling multiple GPU applications while providing rigorous real-time guarantees remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose RTGPU, which can schedule the execution of multiple GPU applications in real-time to meet hard deadlines. Each GPU application can have multiple CPU execution and memory copy segments, as well as GPU kernels. We start with a model to explicitly account for the CPU and memory copy segments of these applications. We then consider the GPU architecture in the development of a precise timing model for the GPU kernels and leverage a technique known as persistent threads to implement fine-grained kernel scheduling with improved performance through interleaved execution. Next, we propose a general method for scheduling parallel GPU applications in real time. Finally, to schedule multiple parallel GPU applications, we propose a practical real-time scheduling algorithm based on federated scheduling and grid search (for GPU kernel segments) with uniprocessor fixed priority scheduling (for multiple CPU and memory copy segments). Our approach provides superior schedulability compared with previous work, and gives real-time guarantees to meet hard deadlines for multiple GPU applications according to comprehensive validation and evaluation on a real NVIDIA GTX1080Ti GPU system.

[2101.10465] Identifying acoustic wave sources on the Sun I. Two-dimensional waves in a simulated photosphere	Shah Mohammad Bahauddin Mark Peter Rast	Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics University of Colorado Boulder CO 80303 USADKIST Ambassador National Solar Observatory Boulder CO 80303 USA		The solar acoustic oscillations are likely stochastically excited by convective dynamics in the solar photosphere, though few direct observations of individual source events have been made and their detailed characteristics are still unknown. Wave source identification requires measurements that can reliably discriminate the local wave signal from the background convective motions and resonant modal power. This is quite challenging as these ’noise’ contributions have amplitudes several orders of magnitude greater than the sources and the propagating wave fields they induce. In this paper, we employ a high-temporal-frequency filter to identify sites of acoustic emission in a radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation. The properties of the filter were determined from a convolutional neural network trained to identify the two-dimensional acoustic Green’s function response of the atmosphere, but once defined, it can be directly applied to an image time series to extract the signal of local wave excitation, bypassing the need for the original neural network. Using the filter developed, we have uncovered previously unknown properties of the acoustic emission process. In the simulation, acoustic events are found to be clustered at mesogranular scales, with peak emission quite deep, about 500 km below the photosphere, and sites of very strong emission can result from the interaction of two supersonic downflows that merge at that depth. We suggest that the method developed, when applied to high-resolution high-cadence observations, such as those forthcoming with Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), will have important applications in chromospheric wave-studies and may lead to new investigations in high-resolution local-helioseismology.

[2101.10466] A regression framework for a probabilistic measure of cost-effectiveness	Nicholas Illenberger1 Nandita Mitra1 Andrew J. Spieker2			To make informed health policy decisions regarding a treatment, we must consider both its cost and its clinical effectiveness. In past work, we introduced the net benefit separation (NBS) as a novel measure of cost-effectiveness. The NBS is a probabilistic measure that characterizes the extent to which a treated patient will be more likely to experience benefit as compared to an untreated patient. Due to variation in treatment response across patients, uncovering factors that influence cost-effectiveness can assist policy makers in population-level decisions regarding resource allocation. In this paper, we introduce a regression framework for NBS in order to estimate covariate-specific NBS and find determinants of variation in NBS. Our approach is able to accommodate informative cost censoring through inverse probability weighting techniques, and addresses confounding through a semiparametric standardization procedure. Through simulations, we show that NBS regression performs well in a variety of common scenarios. We apply our proposed regression procedure to a realistic simulated data set as an illustration of how our approach could be used to investigate the association between cancer stage, comorbidities and cost-effectiveness when comparing adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy in post-hysterectomy endometrial cancer patients.	
[2101.10467] Non-embeddable II₁ factors resembling the hyperfinite II₁ factor	Isaac Goldbring	Department of MathematicsUniversity of California Irvine 340 Rowland Hall (Bldg.# 400) Irvine CA isaac	isaac@math.uci.edu	We consider various statements that characterize the hyperfinite IIfactors amongst embeddable IIfactors in the non-embeddable situation. In particular, we show that “generically” a IIfactor has the Jung property (which states that every embedding of itself into its ultrapower is unitarily conjugate to the diagonal embedding) if and only if it is self-tracially stable (which says that every such embedding has an approximate lifting). We prove that the enforceable factor, should it exist, has these equivalent properties. Our techniques are model-theoretic in nature. We also show how these techniques can be used to give new proofs that the hyperfinite IIfactor has the aforementioned properties.

Miksch Tobias Morawietz Johannes Kästner Alexander Urban Nongnuch Artrith	for Theoretical Chemistry University of Stuttgart Pfaffenwaldring 55 70569 Stuttgart Germany.	nartrith@atomistic.net miksch@theochem.uni-stuttgart.de	Recent advances in machine-learning interatomic potentials have enabled the efficient modeling of complex atomistic systems with an accuracy that is comparable to that of conventional quantum-mechanics based methods. At the same time, the construction of new machine-learning potentials can seem a daunting task, as it involves data-science techniques that are not yet common in chemistry and materials science. Here, we provide a tutorial-style overview of strategies and best practices for the construction of artificial neural network (ANN) potentials. We illustrate the most important aspects of (i) data collection, (ii) model selection, (iii) training and validation, and (iv) testing and refinement of ANN potentials on the basis of practical examples. Current research in the areas of active learning and delta learning are also discussed in the context of ANN potentials. This tutorial review aims at equipping computational chemists and materials scientists with the required background knowledge for ANN potential construction and application, with the intention to accelerate the adoption of the method, so that it can facilitate exciting research that would otherwise be challenging with conventional strategies.	
[2101.10469] Probing electroweak phase transition with multi-TeV muon colliders and gravitational waves	Wei Liu Ke-Pan Xie	institutetext:	kpxie@snu.ac.kr wei.liu@njust.edu.cn	We study the complementarity of the proposed multi-TeV muon colliders and the near-future gravitational wave (GW) detectors to the first order electroweak phase transition (FOEWPT), taking the real scalar extended Standard Model as the representative model. A detailed collider simulation shows the FOEWPT parameter space can be greatly probed via the the vector boson fusion production of the singlet, and its subsequent decay to the di-Higgs or di-boson channels. Especially, almost all the parameter space yielding detectable GW signals can be probed by the muon colliders. Therefore, if we could detect stochastic GWs in the future, a muon collider could provide a hopeful crosscheck to identify their origin. On the other hand, there is considerable parameter space that escapes GW detections but is within the reach of the muon colliders. The precision measurements of Higgs couplings could also probe the FOEWPT parameter space efficiently.

[2101.10472] Appliance Operation Modes Identification Using Cycles Clustering	Abdelkareem Jaradat, Hanan Lutfiyya, Anwar Haque{ajarada3, hlutfiyy,  University Of Western Ontario - Department Of Computer ScienceLondon, Ontario, Canada			The increasing cost, energy demand, and environmental issues has led many researchers to find approaches for energy monitoring, and hence energy conservation. The emerging technologies of Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) deliver techniques that have the potential to efficiently conserve energy and improve the utilization of energy consumption. Smart Home Energy Management Systems (SHEMSs) have the potential to contribute in energy conservation through the application of Demand Response (DR) in the residential sector. In this paper, we propose appliances Operation Modes Identification using Cycles Clustering (OMICC) which is SHEMS fundamental approach that utilizes the sensed residential disaggregated power consumption in supporting DR by providing consumers the opportunity to select lighter appliance operation modes. The cycles of the Single Usage Profile (SUP) of an appliance are extracted and reformed into features in terms of clusters of cycles. These features are then used to identify the operation mode used in every occurrence using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Operation modes identification is considered a basis for many potential smart DR applications within SHEMS towards the consumers or the suppliers.

Neutral-current non-standard interactions would affect neutrino decoupling in the early Universe, thus modifying. We parameterize those operators up to dimension-7 in the effective field theory framework, and then provide a complete, generic and analytical dictionary for the collision term integrals. From precision measurements of, the most stringent constraint is obtained for the dimension-6 vector-type neutrino-electron operator, whose scale is constrained to be above about 195 (331) GeV from Planck (CMB-S4). We find our results complementary to other experiments like neutrino coherent scattering, neutrino oscillation, collider, and neutrino deep inelastic scattering experiments.

With its large center-of-mass energies and yet small Standard Model background, such a machine can not only improve electroweak precision measurements but also probe new physics beyond the Standard Model to an unprecedented level. We study its potential in measuring the Higgs properties, probing the R-parity-violating Supersymmetry, as well as testing heavy new physics in the muonanomaly. We find that for these physics cases the muon-proton collider can perform better than both the ongoing and future high-energy collider experiments.

Ifis a simply connected domain andis the Riemann mapping fromonto, then the Hardy number of, introduced by Hansen, is the supremum of allfor which. Comb domains are a well-studied class of simply connected domains that, in general, have the form of the entire plane minus an infinite number of vertical rays. In this paper we study the Hardy number of a class of comb domains with the aid of the quasi-hyperbolic distance and we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the Hardy number of these domains to be equal to infinity. Applying this condition, we derive several results that show how the mutual distances and the distribution of the rays affect the finiteness of the Hardy number. By a result of Burkholder our condition is also necessary and sufficient for all moments of the exit time of Brownian motion from comb domains to be infinite.

In this paper we explore programming with point processes in a monadic style. To this end we identify point processes on a spacewith probability measures of bags of elements in. We describe this view of point processes using the composition of the Giry and bag monads on the category of measurable spaces and functions and prove that this composition also forms a monad using a distributive law for monads. Finally, we define a morphism from a point process to its intensity measure, and show that this is a monad morphism. A special case of this monad morphism gives us Wald’s Lemma, an identity used to calculate the expected value of the sum of a random number of random variables. Using our monad we define a range of point processes and point process operations and compositionally compute their corresponding intensity measures using the monad morphism.

Nolan	National Institute of Standards and TechnologyGaithersburg MD of MarylandCollege Park MD USA	Spencer.Breiner@nist.gov jnolan13@terpmail.umd.edu	When designing plans in engineering, it is often necessary to consider attributes associated to objects, e.g. the location of a robot. Our aim in this paper is to incorporate attributes into existing categorical formalisms for planning, namely those based on symmetric monoidal categories and string diagrams. To accomplish this, we define a notion of a “symmetric monoidal category with attributes.” This is a symmetric monoidal category in which objects are equipped with retrievable information and where the interactions between objects and information are governed by an “attribute structure.” We discuss examples and semantics of such categories in the context of robotics to illustrate our definition.

This paper presents a diagrammatic approach to symmetric lenses between categories, through representing the propagation operations with Mealy morphisms. The central result of this paper is to demonstrate that the bicategory of symmetric lenses is locally adjoint to the bicategory of spans of asymmetric lenses, through constructing an explicit adjoint triple between the hom-categories.

The categorical part of the semantics is a monoidal biclosed category with a coalgebra modality as defined on Differential Categories. We instantiate this category to finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps via “quantisation” functors and work with three concrete interpretations of the coalgebra modality. We apply the model to construct categorical and concrete semantic interpretations for the motivating example of: the derivation of a phrase with a parasitic gap. The effectiveness of the concrete interpretations are evaluated via a disambiguation task, on an extension of a sentence disambiguation dataset to parasitic gap phrases, using BERT, Word2Vec, and FastText vectors and Relational tensors.

This calculus enjoys cut elimination and admits focusing, i.e. a subsystem of canonical derivations, which solves the coherence problem for skew monoidal categories.

[2101.10490] Behavioral Mereology: A Modal Logic for Passing Constraints	Brendan Fong David Jaz Myers David I. Spivak			Mereology is the study of parts and the relationships that hold between them. We introduce a behavioral approach to mereology, in which systems and their parts are known only by the types of behavior they can exhibit. Our discussion is formally topos-theoretic, and agnostic to the topos, providing maximal generality; however, by using only its internal logic we can hide the details and readers may assume a completely elementary set-theoretic discussion. We consider the relationship between various parts of a whole in terms of how behavioral constraints are passed between them, and give an inter-modal logic that generalizes the usual alethic modalities in the setting of symmetric accessibility.

[2101.10492] Fast Non-line-of-sight Imaging with Two-step Deep Remapping	Dayu ZhuGeorgia Institute of  Wenshan CaiGeorgia Institute of		dzhu71@gatech.edu wcai@gatech.edu	Conventional imaging only records photons directly sent from the object to the detector, while non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging takes the indirect light into account. Most NLOS solutions employ a transient scanning process, followed by a physical based algorithm to reconstruct the NLOS scenes. However, the transient detection requires sophisticated apparatus, with long scanning time and low robustness to ambient environment, and the reconstruction algorithms are typically time-consuming and computationally expensive. Here we propose a new NLOS solution to address the above defects, with innovations on both equipment and algorithm. We apply inexpensive commercial Lidar for detection, with much higher scanning speed and better compatibility to real-world imaging. Our reconstruction framework is deep learning based, with a generative two-step remapping strategy to guarantee high reconstruction fidelity. The overall detection and reconstruction process allows for millisecond responses, with reconstruction precision of millimeter level. We have experimentally tested the proposed solution on both synthetic and real objects, and further demonstrated our method to be applicable to full-color NLOS imaging.

Transparency is a key factor in the performance of human-robot interaction. A transparent interface allows operators to be aware of the state of a robot and to assess the progress of the tasks at hand. When multi-robot systems are involved, transparency is a greater challenge, due to the larger number of variables affecting the behavior of the robots as a whole. Existing work studies transparency with single operators and multiple robots. Studies on transparency that focus onmultipleoperators interacting with a multi-robot systems are limited. This paper fills this gap by presenting a novel human-swarm interface for multiple operators. Through this interface, we study which graphical elements are contributing to multi-operator transparency by comparing four “transparency modes”:(i)no transparency (no operator receives information from the robots),(ii)central transparency (the operators receive information only relevant to their personal task),(iii)peripheral transparency (the operators share information on each others’ tasks), and(iv)mixed transparency (both central and peripheral).We report the results in terms of awareness, trust, and workload from a user study involving 18 participants engaged in a complex multi-robot task.

Luscher		dblaschke@lanl.gov djl@lanl.gov	Plastic deformation is mediated by the creation and movement of dislocations, and at high stress the latter is dominated by dislocation drag from phonon wind. By simulating a 1-D shock impact problem we analyze the importance of accurately modeling dislocation drag and dislocation density evolution in the high stress regime. Dislocation drag is modeled according to a first-principles derivation as a function of stress and dislocation character, and its temperature and density dependence are approximated to the extent currently known. Much less is known about dislocation density evolution, leading to far greater uncertainty in these model parameters. In studying anisotropic fcc metals with character dependent dislocations, the present work generalizes similar earlier studies by other authors.

However, the performance is not very satisfactory with moderate code length. Heuristic or deep-learning-aided (DL-aided) flip algorithms have been developed to tackle this problem. The key for successful flip decoding is to accurately identify error bit positions. In this work, we propose a new flip algorithm with help of differentiable neural computer (DNC). New state and action encoding are developed for better DNC training and inference efficiency. The proposed method consists of two phases: i) a flip DNC (F-DNC) is exploited to rank most likely flip positions for multi-bit flipping; ii) if decoding still fails, a flip-validate DNC (FV-DNC) is used to re-select error bit positions for successive flip decoding trials. Supervised training methods are designed accordingly for the two DNCs. Simulation results show that proposed DNC-aided SCL-Flip (DNC-SCLF) decoding demonstrates up to 0.34dB coding gain improvement or 54.2% reduction in average number of decoding attempts compared to prior works.

However, existing instruction generators have not been comprehensively evaluated, and the automatic evaluation metrics used to develop them have not been validated. Using human wayfinders, we show that these generators perform on par with or only slightly better than a template-based generator and far worse than human instructors. Furthermore, we discover that BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR and CIDEr are ineffective for evaluating grounded navigation instructions. To improve instruction evaluation, we propose an instruction-trajectory compatibility model that operates without reference instructions. Our model shows the highest correlation with human wayfinding outcomes when scoring individual instructions.

We present an overview of the multi-messenger activities of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The overview includes: searches for ultra-high energy photons and neutrinos detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory in coincidence with gravitational wave events detected by LIGO and Virgo; searches for correlations of the arrival directions of UHECRs detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory and high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube and ANTARES; searches for Galactic neutrons; the multi-messenger campaign “Deeper, Wider, Faster”, aiming for common observations of a variety of complementary instruments.

However, their performance is not completely understood theoretically. In this paper, we characterize theglobalconvergence of an online natural actor-critic algorithm in the tabular setting using a single trajectory of samples. Our analysis applies to very general settings, as we only assume ergodicity of the underlying Markov decision process. In order to ensure enough exploration, we employ an-greedy sampling of the trajectory.

These sectors correspond to the supermembrane theory formulated on aon three different constant three-form backgrounds: M2-brane with constant, M2-brane with constantand M2-brane with a generic constantdenoted as CM2-brane. The first two exhibit a purely discrete supersymmetric spectrum once the central charge condition, or equivalently, the corresponding flux condition has been turned on. The CM2-brane is conjectured to share this spectral property once that fluxesare turned on. As shown in[1]they are duals to three inequivalent sectors of the D2-branes with specific worldvolume and background RR and NSNS quantization conditions on each case.

Kukkonen Kun Chen		kunchen@flatironinstitute.org 20kunchen@flatironinstitute.org kukkonen@cox.net	The effective electron-electron interaction in the electron gas depends on both the density and spin local field factors. Variational Diagrammatic Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the spin local field factor are reported and used to quantitatively present the full spin-dependent, electron-electron interaction. Together with the charge local field factor from previous Diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we obtain the complete form of the effective electron-electron interaction in the uniform three-dimensional electron gas. Very simple quadratic formulas are presented for the local field factors that quantitatively produce all of the response functions of the electron gas at metallic densities.

Wagner	Pennsylvania State UniversityState CollegePAUSA	alan.r.wagner@psu.edu aja5755@psu.edu	For many real-world robotics applications, robots need to continually adapt and learn new concepts. Further, robots need to learn through limited data because of scarcity of labeled data in the real-world environments. To this end, my research focuses on developing robots that continually learn in dynamic unseen environments/scenarios, learn from limited human supervision, remember previously learned knowledge and use that knowledge to learn new concepts. I develop machine learning models that not only produce State-of-the-results on benchmark datasets but also allow robots to learn new objects and scenes in unconstrained environments which lead to a variety of novel robotics applications.

[2101.10511] Generic Event Boundary Detection: A Benchmark for Event Segmentation	Mike Zheng Shou Stan Weixian Lei Weiyao Wang Deepti Ghadiyaram Matt Feiszli	Facebook AINational University of Singapore		This paper presents a novel task together with a new benchmark for detecting generic, taxonomy-free event boundaries that segment a whole video into chunks. Conventional work in temporal video segmentation and action detection focuses on localizing pre-defined action categories and thus does not scale to generic videos. Cognitive Science has known since last century that humans consistently segment videos into meaningful temporal chunks. This segmentation happens naturally, without pre-defined event categories and without being explicitly asked to do so. Here, we repeat these cognitive experiments on mainstream CV datasets; with our novel annotation guideline which addresses the complexities of taxonomy-free event boundary annotation, we introduce the task ofGeneric Event Boundary Detection (GEBD)and the new benchmarkKinetics-GEBD. We view GEBD as an important stepping stone towards understanding the video as a whole, and believe it has been previously neglected due to a lack of proper task definition and annotations. Through experiment and human study we demonstrate the value of the annotations. Further, we benchmark supervised and un-supervised GEBD approaches on the TAPOS dataset and our Kinetics-GEBD. We release our annotations and baseline codes atCVPR’21 LOVEU Challenge:https://sites.google.com/view/loveucvpr21.

Next, for eachwe construct a relatively dense setwhich are common-norm almost periods for the diffraction, pure point, absolutely continuous and singular continuous spectrum, respectively, for all subsets. We use the Fibonacci model set to illustrate these phenomena, and extend the results to arbitrary weighted Dirac combs with weak Meyer set support.

[2101.10514] How Good is a Video Summary? A New Benchmarking Dataset and Evaluation Framework Towards Realistic Video Summarization	Vishal Kaushal Suraj Kothawade Anshul Tomar Rishabh Iyer Ganesh Ramakrishnan	Department of Computer Science Indian Institute of Technology Bombay		Automatic video summarization has attracted a lot of interest. However it is still an unsolved problem due to several challenges. We take steps towards making automatic video summarization more realistic by addressing the following challenges. The currently available datasets either have very short videos or have few long videos of only a particular type. We introduce a new benchmarking video dataset called VISIOCITY (VIdeo SummarIzatiOn based on Continuity, Intent and DiversiTY) which comprises of longer videos across six different categories with dense concept annotations capable of supporting different flavors of video summarization and other vision problems. Secondly, for long videos, human reference summaries necessary for supervised video summarization techniques are difficult to obtain. We explore strategies to automatically generate multiple reference summaries from indirect ground truth present in VISIOCITY. We show that these summaries are at par with human summaries. We also present a study of different desired characteristics of a good summary and demonstrate how, especially in long videos, it is quite possible and frequent to have two good summaries with different characteristics. Thus we argue that evaluating a summary against one or more human summaries and using a single measure has its shortcomings. We propose an evaluation framework for better quantitative assessment of summary quality which is closer to human judgment. Lastly, we present insights into how a model can be enhanced to yield better summaries. Sepcifically, when multiple diverse ground truth summaries can exist, learning from them individually and using a combination of loss functions measuring different characteristics is better than learning from a single combined (oracle) ground truth summary using a single loss function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of doing so as compared to some of the representative state of the art techniques tested on VISIOCITY. We release VISIOCITY as a benchmarking dataset and invite researchers to test the effectiveness of their video summarization algorithms on VISIOCITY.	keywords

[2101.10516] Superconducting coherence lengths of hole-doped cuprates obtained from electron-boson spectral density functions	Jungseek Hwang	Electronic address: of Physics Sungkyunkwan University Suwon Gyeonggi-do 16419 Republic of Korea	20jungseek@skku.edu jungseek@skku.edu	Electron–boson spectral density functions (EBSDFs) can be obtained from measured spectra using various spectroscopic techniques, including optical spectroscopy. EBSDFs, known as glue functions, have a magnetic origin. Here, we investigated EBSDFs obtained from the measured optical spectra of hole-doped cuprates with wide doping levels, from underdoped to overdoped cuprates. The average frequency of an EBSDF provides the timescale for the spin fluctuations to form Cooper pairs. This timescale is directly associated with retarded interactions between electrons. Using this timescale and Fermi velocity, a reasonable superconducting coherence length, which reflects the size of the Cooper pair, can be extracted. The obtained coherence lengths were consistent with those measured via other experimental techniques. Therefore, the formation of Cooper pairs in cuprates can be explained by spin fluctuations, the timescales of which appear in EBSDFs. Consequently, EBSDFs provide crucial information on the timescale of the microscopic mechanism of Cooper pair formation.	pacs:74.25.-q | 74.25.Gz | 74.25.Kc

An architecture for cooperation between transportation and energy management systems is introduced that enables us to design an autonomous Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) for the provision of multi-objective AS: primary frequency control in a transmission grid and voltage amplitude regulation in a distribution grid connected to EVs. The design is based on the ordinary differential equation model of distribution voltage, which has been recently introduced as a new physics-based model, and is utilized in this paper for assessing and regulating the impact of spatiotemporal charging/charging of a large population of EVs to a distribution grid. Effectiveness of the autonomous V2G design is evaluated with numerical simulations of realistic models for transmission and distribution grids with synthetic operation data on EVs in a sharing service. In addition, we present a hardware-in-the-loop test for evaluating its feasibility in a situation where inevitable latency is involved due to power, control, and communication equipments.

We observe strong anisotropic electronic properties and an optical gap in the leg direction that is gradually filled above the antiferromagnetic (afm) ordering temperature, turning the systems into a metallic phase. Combining the optical data with the DFT calculations we associate the optical gap feature with the-transition that appears only in the afm ordered state. Hence, the insulating ground state along the leg direction is attributed to Slater physics rather than Mott-type correlations.

Meanwhile, privacy issues arise as large amounts of sensitive device data flow out to IoT platforms. Most of the data flowing to a platform actually do not trigger automation actions, while homeowners currently have no control once devices are bound to the platform. We presentPFirewall, a customizable data-flow control system to enhance the privacy of IoT platform users.PFirewallautomatically generates data-minimization policies, which only disclose minimum amount of data to fulfill automation. In addition,PFirewallprovides interfaces for homeowners to customize individual privacy preferences by defining user-specified policies. To enforce these policies,PFirewalltransparently intervenes and mediates the communication between IoT devices and the platform, without modifying the platform, IoT devices, or hub. Evaluation results on four real-world testbeds show thatPFirewallreduces IoT data sent to the platform by 97% without impairing home automation, andeffectively mitigates user-activity inference/tracking attacks and other privacy risks.

In this work, we focus on Spanglish (Spanish+English) and release a dataset, CSTOP, containing 5800 CS utterances alongside their semantic parses. We examine the CS generalizability of various Cross-lingual (XL) models and exhibit the advantage of pre-trained XL language models when data for only one language is present. As such, we focus on improving the pre-trained models for the case when only English corpus alongside either zero or a few CS training instances are available. We propose two data augmentation methods for the zero-shot and the few-shot settings: fine-tune using translate-and-align and augment using a generation model followed by match-and-filter. Combining the few-shot setting with the above improvements decreases the initial-point accuracy gap between the zero-shot and the full-data settings by two thirds.

AlexandropoulosShanghai Institute for Advanced Communication and Data Science, Shanghai University, ChinaDepartment of Informatics and Telecommunications, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, GreeceEmail: {xcl, shunqing,		alexandg@di.uoa.gr	Precise indoor localization is one of the key requirements for fifth Generation (5G) and beyond, concerning various wireless communication systems, whose applications span different vertical sectors. Although many highly accurate methods based on signal fingerprints have been lately proposed for localization, their vast majority faces the problem of degrading performance when deployed in indoor systems, where the propagation environment changes rapidly. In order to address this issue, the crowdsourcing approach has been adopted, according to which the fingerprints are frequently updated in the respective database via user reporting. However, the late crowdsourcing techniques require precise indoor floor plans and fail to provide satisfactory accuracy. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity self-calibrating indoor crowdsourcing localization system that combines historical with frequently updated fingerprints for high precision user positioning. We present a multi-kernel transfer learning approach which exploits the inner relationship between the original and updated channel measurements. Our indoor laboratory experimental results with the proposed approach and using Nexus 5 smartphones at 2.4GHz with 20MHz bandwidth have shown the feasibility of about one meter level accuracy with a reasonable fingerprint update overhead.

Email:	wangjc@sustech.edu.cn 20wangjc@sustech.edu.cn 20chenyuex@princeton.edu chenyuex@princeton.edu	A local artificial neural network (LANN) framework is developed for turbulence modeling. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) unclosed terms are reconstructed by artificial neural network (ANN) based on the local coordinate system which is orthogonal to the curved walls. We verify the proposed model for the flows over periodic hills. The correlation coefficients of the RANS unclosed terms predicted by the LANN model can be made larger than 0.96 in ana priorianalysis, and the relative error of the unclosed terms can be made smaller than 18. In ana posteriorianalysis, detailed comparisons are made on the results of RANS simulations using the LANN and Spalart-Allmaras (SA) models. It is shown that the LANN model performs better than the SA model in the prediction of the average velocity, wall-shear stress and average pressure, which gives the results that are essentially indistinguishable from the direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. The LANN model trained in low Reynolds numbercan be directly applied in the cases of high Reynolds numbers, 10595, 19000, 37000 with accurate predictions. Furthermore, the LANN model is verified for flows over periodic hills with varying slopes. These results suggest that the LANN framework has a great potential to be applied to complex turbulent flows with curved walls.	pacs:Valid PACS appear here

[2101.10530] Ocean Circulation on Enceladus With a High Versus Low Salinity Ocean	Yaoxuan Zeng Malte F. Jansen	Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences School of Physics Peking University Beijing 100871 China.		Previous studies that have considered the ocean circulation on Enceladus have generally assumed the salinity to be Earth-like. However, according to observations and geochemical constraints, the salinity of Enceladus’ ocean is likely to be lower, and importantly, it is probably low enough to reverse the sign of thermal expansivity. We investigate the ocean circulation and stratification of Enceladus’ ocean using a combination of theoretical arguments and simulations using the MITgcm. We find that, if the salinity is high, the whole ocean is unstratified, and convection dominates the entire ocean. However, if the salinity is low enough, there exists a stratified layer in the upper ocean, whose thickness depends on the magnitude of the turbulent vertical diffusivity, which remains poorly constrained. Such a layer can suppress the vertical flux of heat and tracers, thereby affecting the heat flux to the ice shell and leading to a vertical tracer mixing time scale across the stratified layer of at least hundreds of years. This time scale is inconsistent with a previous estimate of vertical ocean mixing of several years, based on the size of detected silica nanoparticles in the plumes, leading us to conclude that either the salinity of Enceladus’ ocean is higher than previously suggested or the interpretation of silica nanoparticle observations has to be reconsidered.

However, 2D CNN only considers the spatial information and ignores the spectral information whereas 3D CNN jointly exploits spatial-spectral information at a high computational cost. Therefore, this work proposed a lightweight CNN (3D followed by 2D-CNN) model which significantly reduces the computational cost by distributing spatial-spectral feature extraction across a lighter model alongside a preprocessing that has been carried out to improve the classification results. Five benchmark Hyperspectral datasets (i.e., SalinasA, Salinas, Indian Pines, Pavia University, Pavia Center, and Botswana) are used for experimental evaluation. The experimental results show that the proposed pipeline outperformed in terms of generalization performance, statistical significance, and computational complexity, as compared to the state-of-the-art 2D/3D CNN models except commonly used computationally expensive design choices.

In contrast to many conventional methods, the shot noise approach remains practical even in the multidimensional setting. We provide a brief introduction to shot noise representations of infinitely divisible laws and related processes, and discuss the truncation of such series representations towards the simulation of infinitely divisible random vectors, Lévy processes, infinitely divisible processes and fields and Lévy-driven stochastic differential equations.

Here we propose and pursue an experimental strategy that, while focusing on various HCIs of a single atomic element, keeps the number of candidate clock transitions as large as possible. Following this strategy, we identify four adjacent charge states of nickel HCIs that offer as many as six optical transitions. Experimentally, we demonstrated the essential capability of producing these ions in the low-energy compact Shanghai-Wuhan Electron Beam Ion Trap. We measured the wavelengths of four magnetic-dipole (1) and one electric-quadrupole (2) clock transitions with an accuracy of several ppm with a novel calibration method; two of these lines were observed and characterized for the first time in controlled laboratory settings. Compared to the earlier determinations, our measurements improved wavelength accuracy by an order of magnitude. Such measurements are crucial for constraining the range of laser wavelengths for finding the “needle in a haystack” narrow lines. In addition, we calculated frequencies and quality factors, evaluated sensitivity of these six transitions to the hypothetical variation of the electromagnetic fine structure constantneeded for fundamental physics applications. We argue that all the six transitions in nickel HCIs offer intrinsic immunity to all common perturbations of quantum oscillators, and one of them has the projected fractional frequency uncertainty down to the remarkable level of 10.	
[2101.10539] Arabic aspect based sentiment analysis using bidirectional GRU based models	Mohammed M.Abdelgwad Taysir Hassan A Soliman Ahmed I.Taloba Mohamed Fawzy Farghaly		Taloba@aun.edu.eg taysirhs@aun.edu.eg mfseddik@aun.edu.eg mohammed.mustafa@aun.edu.eg	Aspect-based Sentiment analysis (ABSA) accomplishes a fine-grained analysis that defines the aspects of a given document or sentence and the sentiments conveyed regarding each aspect. This level of analysis is the most detailed version that is capable of exploring the nuanced viewpoints of the reviews. The bulk of study in ABSA focuses on English with very little work available in Arabic. Most previous work in Arabic has been based on regular methods of machine learning that mainly depends on a group of rare resources and tools for analyzing and processing Arabic content such as lexicons, but the lack of those resources presents another challenge. In order to address these challenges, Deep Learning (DL)-based methods are proposed using two models based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) neural networks for ABSA. The first is a DL model that takes advantage of word and character representations by combining bidirectional GRU, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Conditional Random Field (CRF) making up the (BGRU-CNN-CRF) model to extract the main opinionated aspects (OTE). The second is an interactive attention network based on bidirectional GRU (IAN-BGRU) to identify sentiment polarity toward extracted aspects. We evaluated our models using the benchmarked Arabic hotel reviews dataset proposed by(Pontiki et al.,,2016). The results indicate that the proposed methods are better than baseline research on both tasks having 39.7% enhancement in F1-score for opinion target extraction (T2) and 7.58% in accuracy for aspect-based sentiment polarity classification (T3). Achieving F1 score of 70.67% for T2, and accuracy of 83.98% for T3.

We strengthen the weak learnability condition in\citeasnounZhuZouRossetandHastie09 by requiring that the weak learnability condition holds for any subset of labels with at least two elements. This condition is simpler to check than many proposed alternatives (e.g.,\citeasnounMukherjeeSchapire2013). As SAMME, our algorithm is reduced to the Adaptive Boosting algorithm (\citeasnounSchapireandFreund12) if the number of labels is two, and can be motivated as a functional version of the steepest descending method to find an optimal solution. In contrast to SAMME, our algorithm’s final hypothesis converges to the correct label with probability 1. For any number of labels, the probability of misclassification vanishes exponentially as the training period increases. The sum of the training error and an additional term, that depends only on the sample size, bounds the generalization error of our algorithm as the Adaptive Boosting algorithm.Keywords.Adaptive Boosting Algorithm, SAMME, Iterative Weak Learnability, Efficient Ensemble Algorithm, Generalization Error	Keywords.

Ritam Dutt, Sayan Sinha, Rishabh Joshi, Surya Shekhar Chakraborty,Meredith Riggs, Xinru Yan, Haogang Bao, Carolyn Penstein RoséCarnegie Mellon University,Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur,Zendrive	footnotetext:	sayan.sinha@iitkgp.ac.in suryaschak@gmail.com	Modelling persuasion strategies as predictors of task outcome has several real-world applications and has received considerable attention from the computational linguistics community. However, previous research has failed to account for the resisting strategies employed by an individual to foil such persuasion attempts. Grounded in prior literature in cognitive and social psychology, we propose a generalised framework for identifying resisting strategies in persuasive conversations. We instantiate our framework on two distinct datasets comprising persuasion and negotiation conversations. We also leverage a hierarchical sequence-labelling neural architecture to infer the aforementioned resisting strategies automatically. Our experiments reveal the asymmetry of power roles in non-collaborative goal-directed conversations and the benefits accrued from incorporating resisting strategies on the final conversation outcome. We also investigate the role of different resisting strategies on the conversation outcome and glean insights that corroborate with past findings. We also make the code and the dataset of this work publicly available athttps://github.com/americast/resper.

This study covers the Steepest Gradient Descent Method, the Newton-Raphson Method, and the Fletcher-Reeves Conjugate Gradient method. In addition, four different step-size selecting methods including fixed-step-size, variable step-size, quadratic-fit, and golden section method were considered. Due to the computational nature of solving minimization problems, testing the algorithms is an essential part of this paper. Therefore, an extensive set of numerical test results is also provided to present an insightful and a comprehensive comparison of the reviewed algorithms. This study highlights the differences and the trade-offs involved in comparing these algorithms.

The laser peak intensity and wavelength are varied to find suitable parameters for high-harmonic imaging in the water window. Comparison of the SAE and RMT results shows qualitative agreement between them as well as parameters such as the cutoff frequency predicted by the classical three-step model. However, there are significant differences in the details, particularly in the predicted conversion efficiency. These details indicate the possible importance of multi-electron effects, as well as a strong sensitivity of quantitative predictions on specific aspects of the numerical model.

We study the joint design of beamformers at an access point (AP) and the phase shifts as well as the energy harvesting schedule at the IRS for maximizing the system sum-rate. The design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem taking into account the wireless energy harvesting capability of IRS elements, secure communications, and the robustness against the impact of channel state information (CSI) imperfection. Subsequently, we propose a computationally-efficient iterative algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to the design problem. In each iteration,-procedure and the successive convex approximation are adopted to handle the intermediate optimization problem. Our simulation results unveil that: 1) there is a non-trivial trade-off between the system sum-rate and the self-sustainability of the IRS; 2) the performance gain achieved by the proposed scheme is saturated with a large number of energy harvesting IRS elements; 3) an IRS equipped with small bit-resolution discrete phase shifters is sufficient to achieve a considerable system sum-rate of the ideal case with continuous phase shifts.

The dust continuum image shows a smooth disk structure with a faint (low-contrast) dust ring, extending fromau toau, not accompanied by any gap. We constructed the simple model to fit the visibility of the observed data by using MCMC method and found that the bump (we call the ring without the gap the bump) has two peaks at 40 au and 70 au. The residual map between the model and observation indicates asymmetric structures at the center and the outer region of the disk. These asymmetric structures are also confirmed by model-independent analysis of the imaginary part of the visibility. The asymmetric structure at the outer region is consistent with a spiral observed by SPHERE. To constrain physical quantities of the disk (dust density and temperature), we carried out radiative transfer simulations. We found that the midplane temperature around the outer peak is close to the freezeout temperature of CO on water ice (K). The temperature around the inner peak is aboutK, which is close to the freezeout temperature of HS and also close to the sintering temperature of several species. We also discuss the size distribution of the dust grains using the spectral index map obtained within the band 6 data.	protoplanetary disks – stars:individual (WW Cha) – stars:pre-main sequence – techniques:interferometric

[2101.10552] A Unified Paths Perspective for Pruning at Initialization	Thomas GebhartDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of  SaxenaSumo  SchraterDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of	Equal contribution	schrater@umn.edu gebhart@umn.edu usaxena@sumologic.com	A number of recent approaches have been proposed for pruning neural network parameters at initialization with the goal of reducing the size and computational burden of models while minimally affecting their training dynamics and generalization performance. While each of these approaches have some amount of well-founded motivation, a rigorous analysis of the effect of these pruning methods on network training dynamics and their formal relationship to each other has thus far received little attention. Leveraging recent theoretical approximations provided by the Neural Tangent Kernel, we unify a number of popular approaches for pruning at initialization under a single path-centric framework. We introduce the Path Kernel as the data-independent factor in a decomposition of the Neural Tangent Kernel and show the global structure of the Path Kernel can be computed efficiently. This Path Kernel decomposition separates the architectural effects from the data-dependent effects within the Neural Tangent Kernel, providing a means to predict the convergence dynamics of a network from its architecture alone. We analyze the use of this structure in approximating training and generalization performance of networks in the absence of data across a number of initialization pruning approaches. Observing the relationship between input data and paths and the relationship between the Path Kernel and its natural norm, we additionally propose two augmentations of the SynFlow algorithm for pruning at initialization.	
[2101.10553] A General Framework Combining Generative Adversarial Networks and Mixture Density Networks for Inverse Modeling in Microstructural Materials Design	Zijiang Yang, Dipendra Jha, Arindam Paul, Wei-keng Liao, Alok Choudhary, Ankit AgrawalDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringNorthwestern University{zyz293, dkj755, apx748, wkliao, choudhar,			Microstructural materials design is one of the most important applications of inverse modeling in materials science. Generally speaking, there are two broad modeling paradigms in scientific applications: forward and inverse. While the forward modeling estimates the observations based on known parameters, the inverse modeling attempts to infer the parameters given the observations. Inverse problems are usually more critical as well as difficult in scientific applications as they seek to explore the parameters that cannot be directly observed. Inverse problems are used extensively in various scientific fields, such as geophysics, healthcare and materials science. However, it is challenging to solve inverse problems, because they usually need to learn a one-to-many non-linear mapping, and also require significant computing time, especially for high-dimensional parameter space. Further, inverse problems become even more difficult to solve when the dimension of input (i.e. observation) is much lower than that of output (i.e. parameters). In this work, we propose a framework consisting of generative adversarial networks and mixture density networks for inverse modeling, and it is evaluated on a materials science dataset for microstructural materials design. Compared with baseline methods, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework can overcome the above-mentioned challenges and produce multiple promising solutions in an efficient manner.	
[2101.10554] 1 Introduction			loskot@gmail.com	Biomedical research is intensive in processing information in the previously published papers. This motivated a lot of efforts to provide tools for text mining and information extraction from PDF documents over the past decade. The *nix (Unix/Linux) operating systems offer many tools for working with text files, however, very few such tools are available for processing the contents of PDF files. This paper reports our effort to develop shell script utilities for *nix systems with the core functionality focused on viewing and searching multiple PDF documents combining logical and regular expressions, and enabling more reliable text extraction from PDF documents with subsequent manipulation of the resulting blocks of text. Furthermore, a procedure for extracting the most frequently occurring multi-word phrases was devised and then demonstrated on several scientific papers in life sciences. Our experiments revealed that the procedure is surprisingly robust to deficiencies in text extraction and the actual scoring function used to rank the phrases in terms of their importance or relevance. The keyword relevance is strongly context dependent, the word stemming did not provide any recognizable advantage, and the stop-words should only be removed from the beginning and the end of phrases. In addition, the developed utilities were used to convert the list of acronyms and the index from a PDF e-book into a large list of biochemical terms which can be exploited in other text mining tasks. All shell scripts and data files are available in a public repository named pdfPapers on the Github. The key lesson learned in this work is that semi-automated methods combining the power of algorithms with the capabilities of research experience are the most promising for improving the research efficiency.

Several numerical examples are also presented to illustrate the validity and robustness of the proposed method.	
[2101.10558] Routing Packet Traffic via Enhanced Access Control List for Network Congestion Avoidance	Zohre R. Mojaveri and András FaragóDepartment of Electrical and Computer ScienceThe University of Texas at DallasRichardson, Texas			Abstract – Filtering packet traffic and rules of permit/denial of data packets into network nodes are granted by facilitating Access Control Lists (ACL). This paper proposes a procedure of adding a link load threshold value to the access control list rules option, which acts on the basis of threshold value. The ultimate goal of this enhanced ACL is to avoid congestion in targeted subnetworks. The link load threshold value allows to decide that packet traffic is rerouted by the router to avoid congestion, or packet drop happens on the basis of packet priorities. The packet rerouting in case of high traffic loads, based on new packet filtering procedure for congestion avoidance, will result in the reduction of the overall packet drop ratio, and of over-subscription in congested subnetworks.

In this context, low-power radar devices have recently gained in popularity as recording sensors, given that the usage of these devices allows mitigating a number of privacy concerns, a key issue when making use of conventional video cameras. Another concern that is often cited when designing smart home applications is the resilience of these applications against cyberattacks. It is, for instance, well-known that the combination of images and CNNs is vulnerable against adversarial examples, mischievous data points that force machine learning models to generate wrong classifications during testing time. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of radar-based CNNs to adversarial attacks, and where these radar-based CNNs have been designed to recognize human gestures. Through experiments with four unique threat models, we show that radar-based CNNs are susceptible to both white- and black-box adversarial attacks. We also expose the existence of an extreme adversarial attack case, where it is possible to change the prediction made by the radar-based CNNs by only perturbing the padding of the inputs, without touching the frames where the action itself occurs. Moreover, we observe that gradient-based attacks exercise perturbation not randomly, but on important features of the input data. We highlight these important features by making use of Grad-CAM, a popular neural network interpretability method, hereby showing the connection between adversarial perturbation and prediction interpretability.

Monsalve-Mercado11footnotemark:1Columbia	footnotemark:	mauro.m.monsalve@columbia.edu katharina.kann@colorado.edu	In contrast to their word- or sentence-level counterparts, character embeddings are still poorly understood. We aim at closing this gap with an in-depth study of English character embeddings. For this, we use resources from research on grapheme–color synesthesia – a neuropsychological phenomenon where letters are associated with colors –, which give us insight into which characters are similar for synesthetes and how characters are organized in color space. Comparing 10 different character embeddings, we ask: How similar are character embeddings to a synesthete’s perception of characters? And how similar are character embeddings extracted from different models? We find that LSTMs agree with humans more than transformers. Comparing across tasks, grapheme-to-phoneme conversion results in the most human-like character embeddings. Finally, ELMo embeddings differ from both humans and other models.

First, we derive such a model as a continuous limit of thetilted ferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice. Then, introducing an additional potential term to the derived Hamiltonian, we obtain exact soliton solutions for particular sets of parameters of the model. The vacuum of the exact solution can be interpreted as a spin nematic state. For a wider range of coupling constants, we construct numerical solutions, which possess the same type of asymptotic decay as the exact analytical solution, both decaying into a spin nematic state.

Particularly, industrial IoT (IIoT) is promoting a new round of industrial revolution. With more applications of IIoT, privacy protection issues are emerging. Especially, some common algorithms in IIoT technology, such as deep models, strongly rely on data collection, which leads to the risk of privacy disclosure. Recently, differential privacy has been used to protect user-terminal privacy in IIoT, so it is necessary to make in-depth research on this topic. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the opportunities, applications, and challenges of differential privacy in IIoT. We first review related papers on IIoT and privacy protection, respectively. Then, we focus on the metrics of industrial data privacy, and analyze the contradiction between data utilization for deep models and individual privacy protection. Several valuable problems are summarized and new research ideas are put forward. In conclusion, this survey is dedicated to complete comprehensive summary and lay foundation for the follow-up research on industrial differential privacy.

[2101.10570] Towards a Secure and Resilient All-Renewable Energy Grid for Smart Cities	Charalambos Konstantinou			The concept of smart cities is driven by the need to enhance citizens’ quality of life. It is estimated that 70% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. The electric grid is the energy backbone of smart city deployments. An electric energy system immune to adverse events, both cyber and physical risks, and able to support the integration of renewable sources will drive a transformational development approach for future smart cities. This article describes how the future electric energy system with 100% electricity supply from renewable energy sources requires the “birth of security and resiliency” incorporated with its ecosystem.

Perry C. Cao M. Smidman H. Q. Yuan	Center for Correlated Matter and Department of Physics Zhejiang University Hangzhou 310058 China	hqyuan@zju.edu.cn msmidman@zju.edu.cn	Evidence for broken time reversal symmetry (TRS) has been found in the superconducting states of theRhSn(R = Sc, Y, Lu) compounds with a centrosymmetric caged crystal structure, but the origin of this phenomenon is unresolved. Here we report neutron diffraction measurements of single crystals with=Lu, as well as measurements of the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth using a self-induced tunnel diode-oscillator (TDO) based technique, together with band structure calculations using density functional theory. Neutron diffraction measurements reveal that the system crystallizes in a tetragonal caged structure, and that one of nominal Lu sites in the LuRhSnstructure is occupied by Sn, yielding a composition LuRhSn(). The low temperature penetration depth shiftexhibits an exponential temperature dependence below around, giving clear evidence for fully gapped superconductivity. The derived superfluid density is reasonably well accounted for by a single gap-wave model, whereas agreement cannot be found for models of TRS breaking states with two-component order parameters. Moreover, band structure calculations reveal multiple bands crossing the Fermi level, and indicate that the aforementioned TRS breaking states would be expected to have nodes on the Fermi surface, in constrast to the observations.	
[2101.10572] Transparent Contribution Evaluation for Secure Federated Learning on Blockchain	Shuaicheng Ma Yang Cao Li Xiong	Emory UniversityAtlanta 	sma30@emory.edu yang@i.kyoto-u.ac.jp lxiong@emory.edu	Federated Learning is a promising machine learning paradigm when multiple parties collaborate to build a high-quality machine learning model. Nonetheless, these parties are only willing to participate when given enough incentives, such as a fair reward based on their contributions. Many studies explored Shapley value based methods to evaluate each party’s contribution to the learned model. However, they commonly assume a semi-trusted server to train the model and evaluate the data owners’ model contributions, which lacks transparency and may hinder the success of federated learning in practice. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning framework and a protocol to transparently evaluate each participant’s contribution. Our framework protects all parties’ privacy in the model building phase and transparently evaluates contributions based on the model updates. The experiment with the handwritten digits dataset demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively evaluate the contributions.

Very often information presented in tables is succinct and hard to interpret with standard language representations. On the other hand, tables often appear within textual context, such as an article describing the table. Using the information from an article as additional context can potentially enrich table representations. In this work we aim to improve question answering from tables by refining table representations based on information from surrounding text. We also present an effective method to combine text and table-based predictions for question answering from full documents, obtaining significant improvements on the Natural Questions dataset.

Linder	Physics Department Nazarbayev University Nur-Sultan KazakhstanEnergetic Cosmos Laboratory Nazarbayev University Nur-Sultan KazakhstanBerkeley Center for Cosmological Physics & Berkeley Lab University of California Berkeley CA USA		We study the quantum radiation of particle production by vacuum from an ultra-relativistic moving mirror (dynamical Casimir effect) solution that allows (possibly for the first time) analytically calculable time evolution of particle creation and an Airy particle spectral distribution. The reality of the beta Bogoliubov coefficients is responsible for the simplicity, and the mirror is asymptotically inertial at the speed of light, with finite energy production. We also discuss general relations regarding negative energy flux, the transformation to the 1-D Schrödinger equation, and the incompleteness of entanglement entropy.	
[2101.10577] Equilibrium shapes and floatability of static and vertically vibrated heavy liquid drops on the surface of a lighter fluid	Andrey Pototsky Alexander Oron Michael Bestehorn	Department of Mathematics Swinburne University of Technology Hawthorn Victoria 3122 	apototskyy@swin.edu.au	A small drop of a heavier fluid may float on the surface of a lighter fluid supported by surface tension forces. In equilibrium, the drop assumes a radially symmetric shape with a circular triple-phase contact line. We show theoretically and experimentally that such a floating liquid drop with a sufficiently small volume has two distinct stable equilibrium shapes: one with a larger and one with a smaller radius of the triple-phase contact line. Next, we experimentally study the floatability of a less viscous water drop on the surface of a more viscous and less dense oil, subjected to a low frequency (Hz-order) vertical vibration. We find that in a certain range of amplitudes, vibration helps heavy liquid drops to stay afloat. The physical mechanism of the increased floatability is explained by the horizontal elongation of the drop driven by subharmonic Faraday waves. The average length of the triple-phase contact line increases as the drop elongates that leads to a larger average lifting force produced by the surface tension.

[2101.10579] Generating Syntactically Controlled Paraphrases without Using Annotated Parallel Pairs	Kuan-Hao HuangUniversity of California, Los  ChangUniversity of California, Los		kwchang@cs.ucla.edu khhuang@cs.ucla.edu	Paraphrase generation plays an essential role in natural language process (NLP), and it has many downstream applications. However, training supervised paraphrase models requires many annotated paraphrase pairs, which are usually costly to obtain. On the other hand, the paraphrases generated by existing unsupervised approaches are usually syntactically similar to the source sentences and are limited in diversity. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to generate syntactically various paraphrases without the need for annotated paraphrase pairs. We proposeSyntactically controlled Paraphrase Generator(SynPG), an encoder-decoder based model that learns to disentangle the semantics and the syntax of a sentence from a collection of unannotated texts. The disentanglement enables SynPG to control the syntax of output paraphrases by manipulating the embedding in the syntactic space. Extensive experiments using automatic metrics and human evaluation show that SynPG performs better syntactic control than unsupervised baselines, while the quality of the generated paraphrases is competitive. We also demonstrate that the performance of SynPG is competitive or even better than supervised models when the unannotated data is large. Finally, we show that the syntactically controlled paraphrases generated by SynPG can be utilized for data augmentation to improve the robustness of NLP models.

However, current SAR cannot yet perceive the unique and diverse set of atypical cognitive-affective behaviors from children with ASD in an automatic and personalized fashion in long-term (multi-session) real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, this work designed and validated personalized models of arousal and valence for children with ASD using a multi-session in-home dataset of SAR interventions. By training machine learning (ML) algorithms with supervised domain adaptation (s-DA), the personalized models were able to trade off between the limited individual data and the more abundant less personal data pooled from other study participants. We evaluated the effects of personalization on a long-term multimodal dataset consisting of 4 children with ASD with a total of 19 sessions, and derived inter-rater reliability (IR) scores for binary arousal (IR = 83%) and valence (IR = 81%) labels between human annotators. Our results show that personalized Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (XGBoost) models with s-DA outperformed two non-personalized individualized and generic model baselines not only on the weighted average of all sessions, but also statistically (¡ .05) across individual sessions. This work paves the way for the development of personalized autonomous SAR systems tailored toward individuals with atypical cognitive-affective and socio-emotional needs.

One of them, GRB 190829A, was triggered by theSwiftsatellite, and abouts after the burst onset the VHE gamma-ray emission was detected by H.E.S.S. withsignificance. This event had unusual features of having much smaller isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energy than typical long GRBs and achromatic peaks in X-ray and optical afterglow at abouts. Here we propose an off-axis jet scenario that explains these observational results. In this model, the relativistic beaming effect is responsible for the apparently small isotropic gamma-ray energy and spectral peak energy. Using a jetted afterglow model, we find that the narrow jet, which has the initial Lorentz factor of 350 and the initial jet opening half-angle of 0.015 rad, viewed off-axis can describe the observed achromatic behavior in the X-ray and optical afterglow. Another wide, baryon-loaded jet is necessary for the later-epoch X-ray and radio emissions. According to our model, the VHE gamma rays observed by H.E.S.S. ats may come from the narrow jet through the synchrotron self-Compton process.	gamma-ray bursts: individual: GRB 190829A — radiation mechanisms: non-thermal
[2101.10582] Modeling the Allee effects induced by cost of predation fear and its carry-over effects	Sourav Kumar Sasmal Yasuhiro Takeuchi		sourav.kumar@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in sourav.sasmal@gmail.com 20sourav.kumar@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in takeuchi@gem.aoyama.ac.jp	Predation driven Allee effects play an important role in the dynamics of small population, however, such predation-driven Allee effects cannot occur for the model with typefunctional response. It generally occurs when a generalist predator targets some specific prey. However, apart from the lethal effects of predation, there are some non-lethal effects in the presence of predator. Due to the fear of predation, positive density dependence growth may be observed at low population density, because of reduced foraging activities. Moreover, this non-lethal effect can be carried over generations. In the present manuscript, we investigate the role of predation fear and its carry-over effects in prey-predator model. First, we study the single species model in global perspective. We have shown that depending on the birth rate, our single species model describes three types of growth dynamics, namely, strong Allee dynamics, weak Allee dynamics and logistic dynamics. Then we consider the explicit dynamics of predator, with typefunctional response. Basic dynamical properties, as well as global stability of each equilibria have been discussed. From our analysis, we can observe that both the fear and its carry-over effects have significant role in the stability of the coexistence equilibrium, even if for the model with typefunctional response. The phenomenon’paradox of enrichment’can be observed in our model, which cannot be observed in the classical prey-predator model with typefunctional response. However, we can see that such phenomenon can be ruled out by choosing suitable non-lethal effect parameters. Therefore, our study shows how non-lethal effects change the dynamics of a competition model, and has important biological insights, specially for the understanding of the dynamics of small populations.

We present a method of computing an open string like expansion, which we call the ’t Hooft expansion, of the-boundary correlator for anyup to any order by directly solving the Korteweg–De Vries equation. We first explain how to compute the ’t Hooft expansion of the one-boundary correlator. The algorithm is very similar to that for the genus expansion of the open free energy. We next show that the ’t Hooft expansion of correlators with more than one boundary can be computed algebraically from the correlators with a lower number of boundaries. We explicitly compute the ’t Hooft expansion of the-boundary correlators for. Our results reproduce previously obtained results for Jackiw–Teitelboim gravity and also the ’t Hooft expansion of the exact result of the three-boundary correlator which we calculate independently in the Airy case.

Many such tools provide users the ability to search for specific entities (e.g. proteins, diseases) by tracking their mentions in papers. PubMed, the most well known database of biomedical papers, relies on human curators to add these annotations. This can take several weeks for new papers, and not all papers get tagged. Machine learning models have been developed to facilitate the semantic indexing of scientific papers. However their performance on the more comprehensive ontologies of biomedical concepts does not reach the levels of typical entity recognition problems studied in NLP. In large part this is due to their low resources, where the ontologies are large, there is a lack of descriptive text defining most entities, and labeled data can only cover a small portion of the ontology. In this paper, we develop a new model that overcomes these challenges by (1) generalizing to entities unseen at training time, and (2) incorporating linking predictions into the mention segmentation decisions. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results for the UMLS ontology in both traditional recognition/linking (+8 F1 pts) as well as semantic indexing-based evaluation (+10 F1 pts).

We focus on LNSVs with in-plane magnetic anisotropy in their free layers. For planar-transverse polarizers (pinned layers of LNSVs), the Walker breakdown can be postponed considerably (practical infinity) by iDMI. More interestingly, the originally unstable traveling mode is also stabilized by iDMI with high saturation velocity thus serves as fast carrier of information. For parallel polarizers, the Walker limit is increased and the corresponding modifications of iDMI to wall velocity in both steady and precessional flows of 180DWs are provided. For perpendicular polarizers, precessional flow of 180DWs is absent due to the stability of stationary mode beyond the modified Walker limit. For LNSVs with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in their free layers, similar results are obtained. Our findings open new possibilities for developing magnetic nanodevices based on 180DW propagation with low energy consumption and high robustness.

Humanoid robots built with a purely tree type architecture tend to be bulky and usually suffer from velocity and force/torque limitations. This paper presents a novel series-parallel hybrid humanoid called RH5 which is 2 m tall and weighs only 62.5 kg capable of performing heavy-duty dynamic tasks with 5 kg payloads in each hand. The analysis and control of this humanoid is performed with whole-body trajectory optimization technique based on differential dynamic programming (DDP). Additionally, we present an improved contact stability soft-constrained DDP algorithm which is able to generate physically consistent walking trajectories for the humanoid that can be tracked via a simple PD position control in a physics simulator. Finally, we showcase preliminary experimental results on the RH5 humanoid robot.

[2101.10595] Probability Trajectory: One New Movement Description for Trajectory Prediction	Pei Lv Hui Wei Tianxin Gu Yuzhen Zhang Xiaoheng Jiang Bing Zhou Mingliang			Trajectory prediction is a fundamental and challenging task for numerous applications, such as autonomous driving and intelligent robots. Currently, most of existing works treat the pedestrian trajectory as a series of fixed two-dimensional coordinates. However, in real scenarios, the trajectory often exhibits randomness, and has its own probability distribution. Inspired by this observed fact, also considering other movement characteristics of pedestrians, we propose one simple and intuitive movement description, probability trajectory, which maps the coordinate points of the pedestrian trajectory to a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution in space. Based on this unique description, we develop one novel trajectory prediction method, calledSocial Probability. The method combines the probability trajectory and powerful convolution recurrent neural networks together. Both the input and output of our method are probability trajectories, which provide the recurrent neural network with sufficient spatial and random information of moving pedestrians. Furthermore, theSocial Probabilityextracts spatio-temporal features directly on the new movement description to generate robust and accurate predicted results. The experiments on public benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

[2101.10597] The Probabilistic Final Standing Calculator: a fair stochastic tool to handle abruptly stopped football seasons	Hans Van Eetvelde Lars Magnus Hvattum Christophe Ley	Department of Applied Mathematics Computer Science and Statistics Ghent University Ghent Belgium		The COVID-19 pandemic has left its marks in the sports world, forcing the full-stop of all sports-related activities in the first half of 2020. Football leagues were suddenly stopped and each country was hesitating between a relaunch of the competition and a premature ending. Some opted for the latter option, and took as the final standing of the season the ranking from the moment the competition got interrupted. This decision has been perceived as unfair, especially by those teams who had remaining matches against easier opponents. In this paper, we introduce a tool to calculate in a fairer way the final standings of domestic leagues that have to stop prematurely: our Probabilistic Final Standing Calculator (PFSC). It is based on a stochastic model taking into account the results of the matches played and simulating the remaining matches, yielding the probabilities for the various possible final rankings. We have compared our PFSC with state-of-the-art prediction models, using previous seasons which we pretend to stop at different points in time. We illustrate our PFSC by showing how a probabilistic ranking of the French Ligue 1 in the stopped 2019-2020 season could have led to alternative, potentially fairer, decisions on the final standing.

Birla Goa Campus Sancoale Goa 403726 India	deydipanjan7@gmail.com divyeshsolanki98@gmail.com cgandevikar@gmail.com	There are many astrophysical scenarios where extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) binaries can be surrounded by matter distribution. The distribution of mass can affect the dynamical properties (e.g. orbital frequency, average energy radiation rate, etc.) of the EMRI. In this matter distribution, instead of Kepler-Newton potential, one may consider a more general form of potential i.e. power law potential. Moreover, due to the power law potential, the velocity profile of test particles does not fall as much as that predicted by Kepler-Newton potential and this feature of the velocity profile may be observationally important. In this study, we have obtained the first post-Newtonian (1PN) expressions for dynamical quantities and the average energy radiation rate from the circular orbit EMRI which is surrounded by a matter distribution.

Here, we propose a simple technique to strongly couple a single solid-state spin to the microwave photons in a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) cavity via a magnetic microsphere. We show that, strong coupling at the single spin level can be realized by virtual magnonic excitations of a nearby micromagnet. The spin-photon coupling strength can be enhanced up to typically four orders of magnitude larger than that without the use of the micromagnet. This work can find applications in quantum information processing with strongly coupled solid-state spin-photonic systems.

Lutchyn	Department of Physics King’s College London Strand Campus London WC2R 2LS UK		We investigate transport properties of ballistic magnetic Josephson junctions and establish that suppression of supercurrent is an intrinsic property of the junctions, even in absence of disorder. By studying the role of ferromagnet thickness, magnetization, and crystal orientation we show how the supercurrent decays exponentially with thickness and identify two mechanisms responsible for the effect: (i) large exchange splitting may gap out minority or majority carriers leading to the suppression of Andreev reflection in the junction, (ii) loss of synchronization between different modes due to the significant dispersion of the quasiparticle velocity with the transverse momentum. Our results for Nb/Ni/Nb junctions are in good agreement with recent experimental studies. Our approach combines density functional theory and Bogoliubov-de Gennes model and opens a path for material composition optimization in magnetic Josephson junctions and superconducting magnetic spin valves.

Recent research focused on designing visual representation of knowledge graphs for expert users. However, how to generate an understandable interface for non-expert users remains to be explored. In this paper, we use knowledge graphs (KGs) as a common ground for knowledge exchange and develop a pattern library for designing KG interfaces for non-expert users. After identifying the types of robotic situational knowledge from the literature, we present a formative study in which participants used cards to communicate the knowledge for given scenarios. We iteratively coded the results and identified patterns for representing various types of situational knowledge. To derive design recommendations for applying the patterns, we prototyped a lab service robot and conducted Wizard-of-Oz testing. The patterns and recommendations could provide useful guidance in designing knowledge-exchange interfaces for robots.	Design Patterns | Interface Design | Knowledge Graph | Human-Robot Interaction

Both effects of hadron rescattering and a combination of different hadrons play a leading role for baryon-strangeness correlations. When the kinetic window is limited to absolute rapidity, these correlations tend to be constant after the final-state interaction whatever kind of hadrons subset we chose based on the AMPT framework. The correlation is found to smoothly increase with baryon chemical potential, corresponding to the collision system or energy from the quark-gluon-plasma-like phase to the hadron-gas-like phase. Besides, the influence of initial nuclear geometrical structures of-clustered nuclear collision systems ofas well ascollisions is discussed but the effect is found negligible. The current model studies provide baselines for searching for the signals of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition and critical point in heavy-ion collisions through the BS correlation.

The performances of two near-field systems with different emitters are examined carefully. One near-field system consists of a graphene-hexagonal-boron-nitride-graphene sandwich structure as the emitter, while the other system has an emitter made of the double graphene-hexagonal-boron-nitride heterostructure. It is shown that both systems exhibit higher output power density and energy efficiency than the near-field system based on mono graphene-hexagonal-boron-nitride heterostructure. The optimal output power density of the former device can reach to, while the optimal energy efficiency can be as large asof the Carnot efficiency. We analyze the underlying physical mechanisms that lead to the excellent performances of the proposed near-field thermophotovoltaic systems. Our results are valuable toward high-performance moderate temperature thermophotovoltaic systems as appealing thermal-to-electric energy conversion (waste heat harvesting) devices.

It is beneficial for applications that are robust to noisy input and intermediate data such as artificial intelligence, multimedia processing, and graph processing. To obtain reasonable outputs from applications on approximate memory, it is crucial to protect critical data while accelerating accesses to non-critical data. We refer the minimum size of a continuous memory region that the same error rate is applied in approximate memory to as theapproximation granularity. A fundamental limitation of approximate memory is that the approximation granularity is as large as a few kilo bytes. However, applications may have critical and non-critical data interleaved with smaller granularity. For example, a data structure for graph nodes can have pointers (critical) to neighboring nodes and its score (non-critical, depending on the use-case). This data structure cannot be directly mapped to approximate memory due to the gap between the approximation granularity and the granularity of data criticality. We refer to this issue as thegranularity gap problem. In this paper, we first show that many applications potentially suffer from this problem. Then we propose a framework to quantitatively evaluate the performance overhead of a possible method to avoid this problem using known techniques. The evaluation results show that the performance overhead is non-negligible compared to expected benefit from approximate memory, suggesting that the granularity gap problem is a significant concern.††*This is an extended version of our conference paper published in the 12ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE).

In the presence of the magnetic field, the subband edge splitting due to the Zeeman energy reaches 0.09 meV at 0.16 T, thereby suggesting an enhanced-factor. The estimated-factor enhancement is 17.5 times that of the bare value. It is considered that a low electron density and high mobility makes it possible to reach a strong many-body interaction regime in which this type of strong enhancement in-factor can be observed.

Despite decades of intensive studies, the mystery of strange metal still defies any sensible theoretical explanation and has been the key puzzle in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we solve a doped Mott insulator model, which unambiguously exhibits SM phenomena accompanied with quantum critical scaling in observables, e.g. resistivity, susceptibility and specific heat. Closer look at SM reveals the breakdown of Landau’s Fermi liquid without any symmetry-breaking, i.e. the violation of Luttinger theorem. Examining electron’s self-energy extracted from numerical simulation provides the explanation on the origin of linear-resistivity and suggests that the long-overlooked static fluctuations in literature play an essential role in non-Fermi liquid behaviors in correlated electron systems.

Based on an isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics model, we study the caloric curve of reactionwith the apparent temperature determined through the charge multiplicity distribution. The caloric curve shows a characteristic signature of nuclear liquid-gas phase transition around the apparent temperature, which is consistent with that through a traditional heavy-ion collision thermometer, and indicates the viability of determining the temperature in heavy-ion collisions with multiplicity distribution.	heavy-ion collision | temperature | machine learning | multiplicity

Characterizing the way in which neural systems reconfigure their interactions to give rise to distinct but hidden brain states remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian model-based characterization of latent brain states and showcase a novel method based on posterior predictive discrepancy using the latent block model to detect transitions between latent brain states in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series. The set of estimated parameters in the model includes a latent label vector that assigns network nodes to communities, and also block model parameters that reflect the weighted connectivity within and between communities. Besides extensivein-silicomodel evaluation, we also provide empirical validation (and replication) using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset of 100 healthy adults. Our results obtained through an analysis of task-fMRI data during working memory performance show appropriate lags between external task demands and change-points between brain states, with distinctive community patterns distinguishing fixation, low-demand and high-demand task conditions.	
[2101.10618] Local shape of the vapor-liquid critical point on the thermodynamic surface and the van der Waals equation of state	J. S. Yu X. Zhou J. F. Chen W. K. Du X. Wang Q. H. Liu	School for Theoretical Physics School of Physics and Electronics Hunan University Changsha 410082 China	quanhuiliu@gmail.com	Differential geometry is powerful tool to analyze the vapor-liquid critical point on the surface of the thermodynamic equation of state. The existence of usual condition of the critical pointrequires the isothermal process, but the universality of the critical point is its independence of whatever process is taken, and so we can assume. The distinction between the critical point and other points on the surface leads us to further assume that the critical point is geometrically represented by zero Gaussian curvature. A slight extension of the van der Waals equation of state is to letting two parametersandin it vary with temperature, which then satisfies both assumptions and reproduces its usual form when the temperature is approximately the critical one.	critical point | van der Waals equation of state | Gaussian curvature | saddle point | response functions

Wang is with Hefei University of Technology Hefei China.Email:	gaoym9@mail2.sysu.edu.cn xdliang328@gmail.com kegong936@gmail.com wangmeng@hfut.edu.cn linliang@ieee.org	Prior highly-tuned image parsing models are usually studied in a certain domain with a specific set of semantic labels and can hardly be adapted into other scenarios (e.g.sharing discrepant label granularity) without extensive re-training. Learning a single universal parsing model by unifying label annotations from different domains or at various levels of granularity is a crucial but rarely addressed topic. This poses many fundamental learning challenges,e.g.discovering underlying semantic structures among different label granularity or mining label correlation across relevant tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a graph reasoning and transfer learning framework, named “Graphonomy”, which incorporates human knowledge and label taxonomy into the intermediate graph representation learning beyond local convolutions. In particular, Graphonomy learns the global and structured semantic coherency in multiple domains via semantic-aware graph reasoning and transfer, enforcing the mutual benefits of the parsing across domains (e.g.different datasets or co-related tasks). The Graphonomy includes two iterated modules: Intra-Graph Reasoning and Inter-Graph Transfer modules. The former extracts the semantic graph in each domain to improve the feature representation learning by propagating information with the graph; the latter exploits the dependencies among the graphs from different domains for bidirectional knowledge transfer. We apply Graphonomy to two relevant but different image understanding research topics: human parsing and panoptic segmentation, and show Graphonomy can handle both of them well via a standard pipeline against current state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, some extra benefit of our framework is demonstrated,e.g., generating the human parsing at various levels of granularity by unifying annotations across different datasets.

In particular, appropriate delay-dependent strategies which are less conservative are suggested. Sufficient conditions for finite-time consensus in the presence of deterministic and stochastic disturbances are presented. The communication delays don’t need to be time invariant, uniform, symmetric, or even known. The only required condition is that all delays satisfy a known upper bound. The consensus algorithm is appropriate for agents with partial access to neighbor agents’ signals. The Lyapunov-Razumikhin theorem for finite-time convergence is used to prove the results. Simulation results on a group of mobile robot manipulators as the agents of the system are presented.

Previous studies have used the heterogeneous response of microswimmers to external magnetic fields for achieving independent control. Here we introduce analytical and reinforcement learning control strategies for path planning to a target by multiple swimmers using a uniform magnetic field. The comparison of the two algorithms shows the superiority of reinforcement learning in achieving minimal travel time to a target.

In our previous paper [J. Chem. Phys.153(2020) 234107], we carried out “exact” numerical experiments using hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) in which we demonstrated that the SB model describes behavior that is consistent with the first and second laws of thermodynamics and that the dynamics of the total system are time irreversible. The distinctive quantity in the Jarzynski equality is the “work characteristic function (WCF)”,, whereis the work performed on the system andis the inverse temperature. In the present investigation, we consider the definitions based on the partition function (PF) and on the path, and numerically evaluate the WCF using the HEOM to determine a method for extending the Jarzynski equality to the fully quantum regime. We show that using the PF-based definition of the WCF, we obtain a result that is entirely inconsistent with the Jarzynski equality, while if we use the path-based definition, we obtain a result that approximates the Jarzynski equality, but may not be consistent with it.

To alleviate these issues, we propose a more fundamental perspective for long-tailed recognition,i.e., from the aspect of parameter space, and aims to preserve specific capacity for classes with low frequencies. From this perspective, the trivial solution utilizes different branches for the head, medium, tail classes respectively, and then sums their outputs as the final results is not feasible. Instead, we design the effective residual fusion mechanism – with one main branch optimized to recognize images from all classes, another two residual branches are gradually fused and optimized to enhance images from medium+tail classes and tail classes respectively. Then the branches are aggregated into final results by additive shortcuts. We test our method on several benchmarks,i.e., long-tailed version of CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Places, ImageNet, and iNaturalist 2018. Experimental results manifest the effectiveness of our method.

Théo RoncalliMaster in Bioinformatics & BiostatisticsUniversity Paris-Saclay,  Théo Le Guenedal, Frédéric Lepetit, Thierry Roncalli, Takaya SekineQuantitative ResearchAmundi Asset Management,		firstname.lastname@amundi.com theo.roncalli@universite-paris-saclay.fr	Like ESG investing, climate change is an important concern for asset managers and owners, and a new challenge for portfolio construction. Until now, investors have mainly measured carbon risk using fundamental approaches, such as with carbon intensity metrics. Nevertheless, it has not been proven that asset prices are directly impacted by these fundamental-based measures. In this paper, we focus on another approach, which consists in measuring the sensitivity of stock prices with respect to a carbon risk factor. In our opinion, carbon betas are market-based measures that are complementary to carbon intensities or fundamental-based measures when managing investment portfolios, because carbon betas may be viewed as an extension or forward-looking measure of the current carbon footprint. In particular, we show how this new metric can be used to build minimum variance strategies and how they impact their portfolio construction.

Under electric fields of several hundred Volt/mm, PVC gels undergo large deformations. These gels can be used as artificial muscles and other soft robotic devices, with striking deformation behavior that is quite different from conventional dielectric elastomers. Here, we present a simple model for the electro-activity of PVC gels, and show a non-linear effect of free ions on its dielectric behaviors. It is found that their particular deformation behavior is due to an electro-wetting effect and to a change in their interfacial tension. In addition, we derive analytical expressions for the surface tension as well as for the apparent dielectric constant of the gel. The theory indicates that the size of the mobile free ions has a crucial role in determining the electro-induced deformation, opening up the way to novel and innovative designs of electro-active gel actuators.

This expression is obtained using the far field approximation for Rayleigh regime. In order to illustrate this results is revisited the classical and standard scattering elastic problem of a dielectric sphere for which the incident field can be any propagation invariant beam.

Email:	azar@tau.ac.il dannyvainstein@gmail.com	Recently, Hierarchical Clustering (HC) has been considered through the lens of optimization. In particular, two maximization objectives have been defined. Moseley and Wang defined theRevenueobjective to handle similarity information given by a weighted graph on the data points (w.l.o.g.,weights), while Cohen-Addad et al. defined theDissimilarityobjective to handle dissimilarity information. In this paper, we prove structural lemmas for both objectives allowing us to convert any HC tree to a tree with constant number of internal nodes while incurring an arbitrarily small loss in each objective. Although the best-known approximations are 0.585 and 0.667 respectively, using our lemmas we obtain approximations arbitrarily close to 1, if not all weights are small (i.e., there exist constantssuch that the fraction of weights smaller than, is at most); such instances encompass many metric-based similarity instances, thereby improving upon prior work. Finally, we introduce Hierarchical Correlation Clustering (HCC) to handle instances that contain similarity and dissimilarity information simultaneously. For HCC, we provide an approximation of 0.4767 and for complementary similarity/dissimilarity weights (analogous tocorrelation clustering), we again present nearly-optimal approximations.

[2101.10642] Evaluation of BERT and ALBERT Sentence Embedding Performance on Downstream NLP Tasks	Hyunjin Choi, Judong Kim, Seongho Joe, and Youngjune Gwon	Samsung SDS Seoul Korea		Contextualized representations from a pre-trained language model are central to achieve a high performance on downstream NLP task. The pre-trained BERT and A Lite BERT (ALBERT) models can be fine-tuned to give state-of-the-art results in sentence-pair regressions such as semantic textual similarity (STS) and natural language inference (NLI). Although BERT-based models yield the[CLS]token vector as a reasonable sentence embedding, the search for an optimal sentence embedding scheme remains an active research area in computational linguistics. This paper explores on sentence embedding models for BERT and ALBERT. In particular, we take a modified BERT network with siamese and triplet network structures called Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and replace BERT with ALBERT to create Sentence-ALBERT (SALBERT). We also experiment with an outer CNN sentence-embedding network for SBERT and SALBERT. We evaluate performances of all sentence-embedding models considered using the STS and NLI datasets. The empirical results indicate that our CNN architecture improves ALBERT models substantially more than BERT models for STS benchmark. Despite significantly fewer model parameters, ALBERT sentence embedding is highly competitive to BERT in downstream NLP evaluations.

[2101.10644] Kinetic derivation of a time-dependent SEIRD reaction-diffusion system for COVID-19	Mohamed Zagour	Institut National des Sciences Appliquées Université EuroMed Fès 	zagourmohamed@gmail.com	In this paper, we propose a time-dependent Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Died (SEIRD) reaction-diffusion system for the COVID-19 pandemic and we deal with its derivation from a kinetic model. The derivation is obtained by mathematical description delivered at the micro-scale of individuals. Our approach is based on the micro-macro decomposition which leads to an equivalent formulation of the kinetic model which couples the microscopic equations with the macroscopic equations. We develop a numerical asymptotic preservation scheme to solve the kinetic model. The proposed approach is validated by various numerical tests where particular attention is paid to the Moroccan situation against the actual pandemic.	
[2101.10645] essHi-C: Essential component analysis of Hi-C matrices	Stefano Franzini Marco Di Stefano Cristian Micheletti	SISSA International School for Advanced Studies Trieste I-34136 Italy.	michelet@sissa.it	Motivation:Hi-C matrices are cornerstones for qualitative and quantitative studies of genome folding, from its territorial organization to compartments and topological domains. The high dynamic range of genomic distances probed in Hi-C assays reflects in an inherent stochastic background of the interactions matrices, which inevitably convolve the features of interest with largely aspecific ones.Results:Here we introduce a discuss essHi-C, a method to isolate the specific, or essential component of Hi-C matrices from the aspecific portion of the spectrum that is compatible with random matrices. Systematic comparisons show that essHi-C improves the clarity of the interaction patterns, enhances the robustness against sequencing depth, allows the unsupervised clustering of experiments in different cell lines and recovers the cell-cycle phasing of single-cells based on Hi-C data. Thus, essHi-C provides means for isolating significant biological and physical features from Hi-C matrices.

In this paper, we investigate the solutions of the Bethe equations for the ASEP in the thermodynamic limit. The Bethe equations for many Hermitian integrable systems, such as the spin-Heisenberg chain, have regular solutions called string solutions. However, in the case of the ASEP, the pattern of the string solution changes owing to its non-hermiticity. We call this new type of string solutions “bundled string solutions”. We introduce and formulate the bundled string solutions, and then derive the Bethe-Takahashi equation for the ASEP.	
[2101.10648] Strategic Evasion of Centrality Measures	Marcin Waniek Jan Woźnica Kai Zhou Yevgeniy Vorobeychik Talal Rahwan Tomasz Michalak	New York University Abu DhabiUniversity of WarsawTo whom correspondence should be	mjwaniek@nyu.edu	Among the most fundamental tools for social network analysis are centrality measures, which quantify the importance of every node in the network. This centrality analysis typically disregards the possibility that the network may have been deliberately manipulated to mislead the analysis. To solve this problem, a recent study attempted to understand how a member of a social network could rewire the connections therein to avoid being identified as a leader of that network. However, the study was based on the assumption that the network analyzer—the seeker—is oblivious to any evasion attempts by the evader. In this paper, we relax this assumption by modelling the seeker and evader as strategic players in a Bayesian Stackelberg game. In this context, we study the complexity of various optimization problems, and analyze the equilibria of the game under different assumptions, thereby drawing the first conclusions in the literature regarding which centralities the seeker should use to maximize the chances of detecting a strategic evader.	
[2101.10649] Analyzing Zero-shot Cross-lingual Transfer in Supervised NLP Tasks	Hyunjin Choi, Judong Kim, Seongho Joe, Seungjai Min, Youngjune Gwon	Samsung SDS		In zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, a supervised NLP task trained on a corpus in one language is directly applicable to another language without any additional training. A source of cross-lingual transfer can be as straightforward as lexical overlap between languages (e.g., use of the same scripts, shared subwords) that naturally forces text embeddings to occupy a similar representation space. Recently introduced cross-lingual language model (XLM) pretraining brings out neural parameter sharing in Transformer-style networks as the most important factor for the transfer. In this paper, we aim to validate the hypothetically strong cross-lingual transfer properties induced by XLM pretraining. Particularly, we take XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) in our experiments that extend semantic textual similarity (STS), SQuAD and KorQuAD for machine reading comprehension, sentiment analysis, and alignment of sentence embeddings under various cross-lingual settings. Our results indicate that the presence of cross-lingual transfer is most pronounced in STS, sentiment analysis the next, and MRC the last. That is, the complexity of a downstream task softens the degree of cross-lingual transfer. All of our results are empirically observed and measured, and we make our code and data publicly available.	
[2101.10650] Neural machine translation, corpus and frugality	Raoul Blin, CNRS-CRLAO,		blin@ehess.fr	In machine translation field, in both academia and industry, there is a growing interest in increasingly powerful systems, using corpora of several hundred million to several billion examples. These systems represent the state-of-the-art. Here we defend the idea of developing in parallel“frugal”bilingual translation systems, trained with relatively small corpora. Based on the observation of a standard human professional translator, we estimate that the corpora should be composed at maximum of a monolingual sub-corpus of 75 million examples for the source language, a second monolingual sub-corpus of 6 million examples for the target language, and an aligned bilingual sub-corpus of 6 million bi-examples. A less desirable alternative would be an aligned bilingual corpus of 47.5 million bi-examples.

Cano and David Pereñiguez	institutetext:	pabloantonio.cano@kuleuven.be david.perenniguez@uam.es	We study the scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of planar AdSblack holes with NUT charge. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, these solutions describe a thermal quantum field theory embedded in a Gödel-type universe with closed time-like curves. For a given temperature and NUT charge, two different planar Taub-NUT solutions exist, but we show that only the one with a positive specific heat contributes to the Euclidean saddle point in the path integral. By using the Newman-Penrose formalism, we then derive the master equations satisfied by scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in this background, and show that the corresponding equations are separable. Interestingly, the solutions pile up in the form of Landau levels, and hence are characterized by a single quantum number. We determine the appropriate boundary conditions satisfied by the master variables and using these we compute the quasinormal modes of scalar and gravitational perturbations. On the other hand, electromagnetic perturbations depend on a free parameter whose determination is problematic. We find that all the scalar and gravitational QNM frequencies lie in the lower half of the complex plane, indicating that these Taub-NUT spacetimes are stable. We discuss the implications of these results in the light of the AdS/CFT correspondence.

We examine the valence- and sea-quark contributions to the electromagnetic transition form factors and find that the quadrupole form factors of the sea-quark contributions dominate over those of the valence-quark ones in the smallerregion, whereas the sea quarks only provide marginal contributions to the magnetic dipole transition form factors of the baryon sextet with spin 3/2. The effects of the flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking are in general very small except for the forbidden transitionby-spin symmetry. We also discuss the widths of the radiative decays for the baryon sextet with spin 3/2, comparing the present results with those from other works.

In this work, our goal is to interpret WiFi fingerprints into actual user locations. However, WiFi fingerprint data can be very high dimensional in some cases, we need to find a good representation of the input data for the learning task first. Otherwise, using neural networks will suffer from severe overfitting. In this work, we solve this issue by combining the Information Bottleneck method and Variational Inference. Based on these two approaches, we propose a Variational Information Bottleneck model for accurate indoor positioning. The proposed model consists of an encoder structure and a predictor structure. The encoder is to find a good representation in the input data for the learning task. The predictor is to use the latent representation to predict the final output. To enhance the generalization of our model, we also adopt the Dropout technique for each hidden layer of the decoder. We conduct the validation experiments on a real-world dataset. We also compare the proposed model to other existing methods so as to quantify the performances of our method.

J. van der Burg Jérémy Fensch	Observatoire Astronomique de Strasbourg (ObAS) Universite de Strasbourg - CNRS UMR 7550 Strasbourg FranceInstitute of Physics Laboratory of Astrophysics École Polytechnique Fédéale de Lausanne (EPFL) 1290 Sauverny Switzerland		Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) are very low-surface brightness galaxies with large effective radii. Spectroscopic measurements of a few UDGs have revealed a low dark matter content, based on the internal motion of stars or globular clusters (GCs). This is in contrast to the large number of GCs found for these systems, from which it would be expected to correspond to a large dark matter halo mass. Here we present HST+ACS observations for the UDG MATLAS-2019 in the NGC 5846 group. Using theandfilters, we trace the GC population two magnitudes below the peak of the GC luminosity function (GCLF). Employing Bayesian considerations, we identify 266 GCs associated with the dwarf, yielding a large specific frequency of. We use the turnover of the GCLF to derive a distance of 212 Mpc, which is consistent with the NGC 5846 group of galaxies. Due to the superior image quality of the HST, we are able to resolve the GCs and measure their sizes, which are consistent with the sizes of GCs around Local Group galaxies. Using the linear relation between the total mass of galaxies and of GCs, we derive a halo mass ofM(M/L). The high abundance of GCs, together with the small uncertainties, make MATLAS-2019 one of the most extreme UDGs, which likely sets an upper limit of the number of GCs for UDGs.	editorials | notices — miscellaneous — catalogs — surveys

Moreover, if trivial dotted components are also allowed (i.e. in case of aKirby diagram), the associated PL 4-manifoldis obtained fromby adding 1-handles along the dotted components and 2-handles along the framed components.In this paper we study the relationships between framed links and/or Kirby diagrams and the representation theory of compact PL manifolds by edge-colored graphs: in particular, we describe how to construct algorithmically a (regular) 5-colored graph representing, directly “drawn over” a planar diagram of, or equivalently how to algorithmically obtain a triangulation of. As a consequence, the procedure yields triangulations for any closed (simply-connected) PL 4-manifold admitting handle decompositions without 3-handles.Furthermore, upper bounds for both the invariants gem-complexity and regular genus ofare obtained, in terms of the combinatorial properties of the Kirby diagram.

Pedersen		attia@ruc.dk dyre@ruc.dk urp@ruc.dk	This paper studies numerically the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) system, which is shown to obey hidden scale invariance with a density-scaling exponent that varies from below 5 to above 500. This unprecedented variation makes it advantageous to use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm for tracing out isomorphs. Good isomorph invariance of structure and dynamics is observed over more than three orders of magnitude temperature variation. For all state points studied, the virial potential-energy correlation coefficient and the density-scaling exponent are controlled mainly by the temperature. Based on the assumption of statistically independent pair interactions, a mean-field theory is developed that rationalizes this finding and provides an excellent fit to data at low temperatures and densities.

[2101.10667] Evolutionary Multi-objective Architecture Search Framework: Application to COVID-19 3D CT Classification	Xin He Guohao Ying Jiyong Zhang Xiaowen Chu	institutetext:	xwchu@ust.hk jzhang@hdu.edu.cn	The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened global health. Many studies have applied deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to recognize COVID-19 based on chest 3D computed tomography (CT). Recent works show that no model generalizes well across CT datasets from different countries, and manually designing models for specific datasets requires expertise; thus, neural architecture search (NAS) that aims to search models automatically has become an attractive solution. To reduce the search cost on large 3D CT datasets, most NAS-based works use the weight-sharing (WS) strategy to make all models share weights within a supernet; however, WS inevitably incurs search instability, leading to inaccurate model estimation. In this work, we propose an efficientEvolutionaryMulti-objectiveARchitectureSearch (EMARS) framework. We propose a new objective, namelypotential, which can help exploit promising models to indirectly reduce the number of models involved in weights training, thus alleviating search instability. We demonstrate that under objectives of accuracy and potential, EMARS can balance exploitation and exploration,i.e.,reducing search time and finding better models. Our searched models are small and perform better than prior works on three public COVID-19 3D CT datasets.

To this end, we introduce a new notion of localised metric subdifferential for compactly supported probability measures, and investigate the intrinsic linearised Cauchy problems associated to non-local continuity equations. In particular, we show that when the velocity perturbations belong to the tangent cone to the convexification of the set of admissible velocities, the solutions of these linearised problems are tangent to the solution set of the corresponding continuity inclusion. We then make use of these novel concepts to provide a synthetic and geometric proof of the celebrated Pontryagin Maximum Principle for an optimal control problem with inequality final-point constraints. In addition, we propose sufficient conditions ensuring the normality of the maximum principle.

Stefano Fortunati Alexandre Renaux Frédéric Pascal	institutetext:	frederic.pascal@centralesupelec.fr stefano.fortunati@centralesupelec.fr alexandre.renaux@universite-paris-saclay.fr	The joint estimation of the location vector and the shape matrix of a set of independent and identically Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) distributed observations is investigated from both the theoretical and computational viewpoints. This joint estimation problem is framed in the original context of semiparametric models allowing us to handle the (generally unknown) density generator as aninfinite-dimensionalnuisance parameter. In the first part of the paper, a computationally efficient and memory saving implementation of the robust and semiparmaetric efficient-estimator for shape matrices is derived. Building upon this result, in the second part, a joint estimator, relying on the Tyler’s-estimator of location and on the-estimator of shape matrix, is proposed and its Mean Squared Error (MSE) performance compared with the Semiparametric Cramér-Rao Bound (CSCRB).

Udby	Center Niels Bohr Institute University of Copenhagen 2100 Copenhagen Ø Denmark	sonja@nbi.ku.dk	We present a combined neutron diffraction and high-field muon spin rotation (SR) study of the magnetic and superconducting phases of the high-temperature superconductor LaSrCuO(K). We observe a linear dependence of the neutron diffraction signal from the modulated antiferromagnetic stripe order on the applied field. The magnetic volume fraction measured withSR increases linearly from 0% to40% with applied magnetic field up to 8 T. This allows us to conclude, in contrast to earlier field-dependent neutron diffraction studies, that the ordered stripe regions are induced by an applied field, and that their ordered magnetic moment is field-independent.	
[2101.10673] The Linkage between the Core Mass and the Magnetic Field of an Extrasolar Giant Planet from Future Radio Observations	Yasunori Hori	Astrobiology Center 2-21-1 Osawa Mitaka Tokyo 1818588 JapanNational Astronomical Observatory of Japan 2-21-1 Osawa Mitaka Tokyo 1818588 Japan		Close-in gas giants are expected to have a strong magnetic field ofG. Magnetic fields in extrasolar giant planets are detectable by future radio observations inMHz and the spectropolarimetry of atomic lines. In contrast, the elusive interiors of exoplanets remain largely unknown. Here we consider the possibility of inferring the existence of the innermost cores of extrasolar giant planets through the detection of planetary magnetic fields. We simulated the long-term thermal evolution of close-in giant planets with masses ofto estimate their magnetic field strengths. A young, massive gas giant tends to have a strong magnetic field. The magnetic field strength of a hot Jupiter is insensitive to its core mass, whereas the core strongly affects the emergence of a planetary dynamo in a hot Saturn. No dynamo-driven magnetic field is generated in a hot Saturn with no core or a small one untilMyr if metallization of hydrogen occurs atMbar. The magnetic field strength of an evolved gas giant afteris almost independent of the stellar incident flux. Detecting the magnetic field of a young, hot Saturn as a good indicator of its core may be challenging because of the weakness of radio signals and the shielding effect of plasma in the Earth’s ionosphere. Hot Jupiters withcan be promising candidates for future ground-based radio observations.	Exoplanets; Planetary Interior; Magnetic fields
[2101.10674] LEVERAGING 3D INFORMATION IN UNSUPERVISED BRAIN MRI SEGMENTATION				Automatic segmentation of brain abnormalities is challenging, as they vary considerably from one pathology to another. Current methods are supervised and require numerous annotated images for each pathology, a strenuous task. To tackle anatomical variability, Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) methods are proposed, detecting anomalies as outliers of a healthy model learned using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Previous work on UAD adopted a 2D approach, meaning that MRIs are processed as a collection of independent slices. Yet, it does not fully exploit the spatial information contained in MRI. Here, we propose to perform UAD in a 3D fashion and compare 2D and 3D VAEs. As a side contribution, we present a new loss function guarantying a robust training. Learning is performed using a multicentric dataset of healthy brain MRIs, and segmentation performances are estimated on White-Matter Hyperintensities and tumors lesions. Experiments demonstrate the interest of 3D methods which outperform their 2D counterparts.	
[2101.10675] Discrete Adaptive Control Allocation	S. S. TohidiMechasnical Engineering DepartmentBilkent UniversityAnkara, 06800  YildizMechasnical Engineering DepartmentBilkent UniversityAnkara, 06800		yyildiz@bilkent.edu shahabaldin@bilkent.edu.tr	The main purpose of a control allocator is to distribute a total control effort among redundant actuators. This paper proposes a discrete adaptive control allocator for over-actuated sampled-data systems in the presence of actuator uncertainty. The proposed method does not require uncertainty estimation or persistency of excitation. Furthermore, the presented algorithm employs a closed loop reference model, which provides fast convergence without introducing excessive oscillations. To generate the total control signal, an LQR controller with reference tracking is used to guarantee the outer loop asymptotic stability. The discretized version of the Aerodata Model in Research Environment (ADMIRE) is used as an over-actuated system, to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

We refer to the monograph [53] for a more detailed presentation of the whole theory, while the survey paper [56] is mainly for the engineering-oriented readers.	Qi Lü and Xu Zhang	thanks:	xu@scu.edu.cn lu@scu.edu.cn	The aim of this notes is to give a concise introduction to control theory for systems governed by stochastic partial differential equations. We shall mainly focus on controllability and optimal control problems for these systems. For the first one, we present results for the exact controllability of stochastic transport equations, null and approximate controllability of stochastic parabolic equations and lack of exact controllability of stochastic hyperbolic equations. For the second one, we first introduce the stochastic linear quadratic optimal control problems and then the Pontryagin type maximum principle for general optimal control problems. It deserves mentioning that, in order to solve some difficult problems in this field, one has to develop new tools, say, the stochastic transposition method introduced in our previous works.

[2101.10679] Robustness of the international oil trade network under targeted attacks to economies	Na Wei Wen-Jie Xie Wei-Xing Zhou		wxzhou@ecust.edu.cn wjxie@ecust.edu.cn	In the international oil trade network (iOTN), trade shocks triggered by extreme events may spread over the entire network along the trade links of the central economies and even lead to the collapse of the whole system. In this study, we focus on the concept of “too central to fail” and use traditional centrality indicators as strategic indicators for simulating attacks on economic nodes, and simulates various situations in which the structure and function of the global oil trade network are lost when the economies suffer extreme trade shocks. The simulation results show that the global oil trade system has become more vulnerable in recent years. The regional aggregation of oil trade is an essential source of iOTN’s vulnerability. Maintaining global oil trade stability and security requires a focus on economies with greater influence within the network module of the iOTN. International organizations such as OPEC and OECD established more trade links around the world, but their influence on the iOTN is declining. We improve the framework of oil security and trade risk assessment based on the topological index of iOTN, and provide a reference for finding methods to maintain network robustness and trade stability.

Together with 51 already covered by the project and an additional 67 in the existing literature, these systems bring the total number of contact binaries with known combined spectroscopic and photometric solutions to 138. It was found that mass, radius and luminosity of the components follow certain relations along the MS and new empirical power relations are extracted. We found that 30 per cent of the systems in the current sample show extreme values in their parameters, expressed in their mass ratio or fill-out factor. This study shows that, among the contact binary systems studied, some have an extremely low mass ratio () or an ultra-short orbital period (d), which are expected to show evidence of mass transfer progress. The evolutionary status of these components is discussed with the aid of correlation diagrams and their physical and orbital parameters compared to those in the entire sample of known contact binaries. The existence of very short orbital periods confirms the very slow nature of the merging process, which seems to explain why their components still exist as MS stars in contact configurations even after several Gyr of evolution.	binary stars – contact binaries – physical parameters – stellar evolution.

[2101.10682] Revisiting non-Gaussianity in non-attractor inflation models in the light of the cosmological soft theorem	Teruaki Suyama Yuichiro Tada Masahide Yamaguchi	Department of Physics Tokyo Institute of Technology 2-12-1 Ookayama Meguro-ku Tokyo 152-8551 Japan	tada.yuichiro@e.mbox.nagoya-u.ac.jp	We revisit the squeezed-limit non-Gaussianity in the single-field non-attractor inflation models from the viewpoint of the cosmological soft theorem. In the single-field attractor models, inflaton’s trajectories with different initial conditions effectively converge into a single trajectory in the phase space, and hence there is only oneclockdegree of freedom (DoF) in the scalar part. Its long-wavelength perturbations can be absorbed into the local coordinate renormalization and lead to the so-calledconsistency relationbetween- and-point functions. On the other hand, if the inflaton dynamics deviates from the attractor behavior, its long-wavelength perturbations cannot necessarily be absorbed and the consistency relation is expected not to hold any longer. In this work, we derive a formula for the squeezed bispectrum including the explicit correction to the consistency relation, as a proof of its violation in the non-attractor cases. First one must recall that non-attractor inflation needs to be followed by attractor inflation in a realistic case. Then, even if a specific non-attractor phase is effectively governed by a single DoF of phase space (represented by the exact ultra-slow-roll limit) and followed by a single-DoF attractor phase, its transition phase necessarily involves two DoF in dynamics and hence its long-wavelength perturbations cannot be absorbed into the local coordinate renormalization. Thus, it can affect local physics, even taking account of the so-calledlocal observer effect, as shown by the fact that the bispectrum in the squeezed limit can go beyond the consistency relation. More concretely, the observed squeezed bispectrum does not vanish in general for long-wavelength perturbations exiting the horizon during a non-attractor phase.

Their flow consists of periods of elastic loading interrupted by rapid stress drops, or avalanches, coming from microscopic rearrangements known as shear transformations (STs). Here we show that the spatial extent of avalanches in a steadily sheared amorphous solid has a profound effect on the distribution of local residual stresses. We find that in this distribution, the most unstable sites are located in a system size dependent plateau. While the entrance into the plateau is set by the lower cutoff of the mechanical noise produced by individual STs, the departure from the usually assumed power-law (pseudogap) formcomes from far field effects related to spatially extended rearrangements. Interestingly, we observe that the average value of weakest sitesis located in an intermediate power law regime between the pseudogap and the plateau regimes, whose exponent decreases with system size. Our findings imply a new scaling relation linking the exponents characterizing the avalanche size and residual stress distributions.

Emails: Corresponding author.	jiaqiyan@tsinghua.edu.cn xu-yang16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn youky@tsinghua.edu.cn ylmo@tsinghua.edu.cn	This paper studies the distributed state estimation in sensor network, wheresensors are deployed to infer the-dimensional state of a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Gaussian system. By a lossless decomposition of optimal steady-state Kalman filter, we show that the problem of distributed estimation can be reformulated as the synchronization of homogeneous linear systems. Based on such decomposition, a distributed estimator is proposed, where each sensor node runs a local filter using only its own measurement, alongside with a consensus algorithm to fuse the local estimate of every node. We prove that the average of estimates from all sensors coincides with the optimal Kalman estimate, and under certain condition on the graph Laplacian matrix and the system matrix, the covariance of estimation error is bounded and the asymptotic error covariance is derived. As a result, the distributed estimator is stable for each single node. We further show that the proposed algorithm has a low message complexity of. Numerical examples are provided in the end to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.	Distributed estimation | Kalman filter | Linear system synchronization | Consensus algorithm.

The mathematical theory of conditional actions is a special case of the theory of “instruments” which describes changes of state due to general measurements and will therefore be briefly outlined in the present paper. As a detailed example we consider the imperfect erasure of a qubit that can also be viewed as a conditional action and will be realized by the coupling of a spin to another small spin system in its ground state."

[2101.10693] Screening the Higgs portal	Philippe Brax Clare Burrage	Institut de Physique Théorique Université Paris-Saclay CEA CNRS F-91191 Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex France		Light scalar fields that couple to matter through the Higgs portal mediate long range fifth forces. We show how the mixing of a light scalar with the Higgs field can lead to this fifth force being screened around macroscopic objects. This behaviour can only be seen by considering both scalar fields as dynamical, and is missed if the mixing between the Higgs field and the scalar field is not taken into account. We explain under which conditions the naive “integrating out” procedure fails, i.e. when the mass matrix of the Higgs-scalars system has a nearly vanishing mass eigenvalue. The resulting flat direction in field space can be lifted at the quadratic order in the presence of matter and the resulting fifth force mediated by the Higgs portal can be screened either when the gravitating objects are large enough or their surface Newton potential exceeds a threshold. Finally we discuss the implications of these results for nearly massless relaxion models.	
[2101.10694] Analytical Bounds for Dynamic Multi-Channel Discrimination	Cillian Harney and Stefano Pirandola	Department of Computer Science University of York York YO10 5GH United Kingdom		The ability to precisely discriminate multiple quantum channels is fundamental to achieving quantum enhancements in data-readout, target detection, pattern recognition, and more. Optimal discrimination protocols often rely on entanglement shared between an incident probe and a protected idler-mode. While these protocols can be highly advantageous over classical ones, the storage of idler-modes is extremely challenging in practice. In this work, we investigate idler-free block protocols based on the use of multipartite entangled probe states. In particular, we focus on a class of idler-free protocol which uses non-disjoint distributions of multipartite probe states irradiated over multi-channels, known as dynamic discrimination protocols. We derive new, analytical bounds for the average error probability of such protocols in a bosonic Gaussian channel setting, revealing idler-free strategies that display performance close to idler-assistance for powerful, near-term quantum sensing applications.

[2101.10696] AINet: Association Implantation for Superpixel Segmentation	Yaxiong WangYunchao Wei33footnotemark:3Xueming Qian33footnotemark:3Li Zhu22footnotemark:2Yi YangXi’an Jiaotong UniversityBaidu ResearchBeijing Jiaotong UniversityZhejiang University	footnotemark:		Recently, some approaches are proposed to harness deep convolutional networks to facilitate superpixel segmentation. The common practice is to first evenly divide the image into a pre-defined number of grids and then learn to associate each pixel with its surrounding grids. However, simply applying a series of convolution operations with limited receptive fields can only implicitly perceive the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids. Consequently, existing methods often fail to provide an effective context when inferring the association map. To remedy this issue, we propose a novelAssociationImplantation (AI) module to enable the network to explicitly capture the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids. The proposed AI module directly implants the features of grid cells to the surrounding of its corresponding central pixel, and conducts convolution on the padded window to adaptively transfer knowledge between them. With such an implantation operation, the network could explicitly harvest the pixel-grid level context, which is more in line with the target of superpixel segmentation comparing to the pixel-wise relation. Furthermore, to pursue better boundary precision, we design a boundary-perceiving loss to help the network discriminate the pixels around boundaries in hidden feature level, which could benefit the subsequent inferring modules to accurately identify more boundary pixels. Extensive experiments on BSDS500 and NYUv2 datasets show that our method could not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but maintain satisfactory inference efficiency.

[2101.10698] A fast algorithm for complex discord searches in time series: HOT SAX Time	Paolo Avogadro Matteo Alessandro Dominoni	institutetext:	paolo.avogadro@unimib.it matteo.dominoni@unimib.it	Time series analysis is quickly proceeding towards long and complex tasks. In recent years, fast approximate algorithms for discord search have been proposed in order to compensate for the increasing size of the time series. It is more interesting, however, to find quick exact solutions. In this research, we improved HOT SAX by exploiting two main ideas: the warm-up process, and the similarity between sequences close in time. The resulting algorithm, called HOT SAX Time (HST), has been validated with real and synthetic time series, and successfully compared with HOT SAX, RRA, SCAMP, and DADD. The complexity of a discord search has been evaluated with a new indicator, the cost per sequence (cps), which allows one to compare searches on time series of different lengths. Numerical evidence suggests that two conditions are involved in determining the complexity of a discord search in a non-trivial way: the length of the discords, and the noise/signal ratio. In the case of complex searches, HST can be more than 100 times faster than HOT SAX, thus being at the forefront of the exact discord search.

[2101.10699] Measuring Decentralization in Bitcoin and Ethereum using Multiple Metrics and Granularities	Qinwei Lin1, Chao Li12, Xifeng Zhao1 and Xianhai Chen1	1School of Computer and Information Technology Beijing Jiaotong University China2Beijing Key Laboratory of Security and Privacy in Intelligent Transportation Beijing Jiaotong University China	li.chao@bjtu.edu.cn	Decentralization has been widely acknowledged as a core virtue of blockchains. However, in the past, there have been few measurement studies on measuring and comparing the actual level of decentralization between existing blockchains using multiple metrics and granularities. This paper presents a new comparison study of the degree of decentralization in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two most prominent blockchains, with various decentralization metrics and different granularities within the time dimension. Specifically, we measure the degree of decentralization in the two blockchains during 2019 by computing the distribution of mining power with three metrics (Gini coefficient, Shannon entropy, and Nakamoto coefficient) as well as three granularities (days, weeks, and months). Our measurement results with different metrics and granularities reveal the same trend that, compared with each other, the degree of decentralization in Bitcoin is higher, while the degree of decentralization in Ethereum is more stable. To obtain the cross-interval information missed in the fixed window based measurements, we propose the sliding window based measurement approach. The corresponding results demonstrate that the use of sliding windows could reveal additional cross-interval information overlooked by the fixed window based measurements, thus enhancing the effectiveness of measuring decentralization in terms of continuous trends and abnormal situations. We believe that the methodologies and findings in this paper can facilitate future studies of decentralization in blockchains.	Blockchain | Decentralization | Bitcoin | Ethereum
[2101.10700] Semi-classical Lindblad master equation for spin dynamics				We derive the semi-classical Lindblad master equation in phase space for both canonical and non-canonical Poisson brackets using the Wigner-Moyal formalism and the Moyal star-product. The semi-classical limit for canonical dynamical variables, i. e., canonical Poisson brackets, is the Fokker-Planck equation, as derived before. We generalize this limit and show that it holds also for non-canonical Poisson brackets. Examples are gyro-Poisson brackets, which occur in spin ensembles, systems of recent interest in atomic physics and quantum optics. We show that the equations of motion for the collective spin variables are given by the Bloch equations of nuclear magnetization with relaxation. The Bloch and relaxation vectors are expressed in terms of the microscopic operators: The Hamiltonian and the Lindblad functions in the Wigner-Moyal formalism.	Keywords

You are all with National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory Southeast University Nanjing China ( emails: {xujunseu p.zhu is with the Department of Electrical Engineering Columbia University New York NY 10027	wangx@ee.columbia.edu	We consider a cell-free hybrid massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system withusers andaccess points (APs), each withantennas andradio frequency (RF) chains. When, efficient uplink channel estimation and data detection with reduced number of pilots can be performed based on low-rank matrix completion. However, such a scheme requires the central processing unit (CPU) to collect received signals from all APs, which may enable the CPU to infer the private information of user locations. We therefore develop and analyze privacy-preserving channel estimation schemes under the framework of differential privacy (DP). As the key ingredient of the channel estimator, two joint differentially private noisy matrix completion algorithms based respectively on Frank-Wolfe iteration and singular value decomposition are presented. We provide an analysis on the tradeoff between the privacy and the channel estimation error. In particular, we show that the estimation error can be mitigated while maintaining the same privacy level by increasing the payload size with fixed pilot size; and the scaling laws of both the privacy-induced and privacy-independent error components in terms of payload size are characterized. Simulation results are provided to further demonstrate the tradeoff between privacy and channel estimation performance.

ChinaSchool of Rail Transportation Soochow University Suzhou Jiangsu 215131 P. R. China	tjia@swu.edu.cn	The study of network structural controllability focuses on the minimum number of driver nodes needed to control a whole network. Despite intensive studies on this topic, most of them consider static networks only. It is well-known, however, that real networks are growing, with new nodes and links added to the system. Here, we analyze controllability of evolving networks and propose a general rule for the change of driver nodes. We further apply the rule to solve the problem of network augmentation subject to the controllability constraint. The findings fill a gap in our understanding of network controllability and shed light on controllability of real systems.	network controllability | growing networks | complex networks

Is it possible, for instance, to design general-purpose representations that detect affect solely from the pixels and audio of a human-computer interaction video? In this paper we address the above questions by evaluating the capacity of deep learned representations to predict affect by relying only on audiovisual information of videos. We assume that the pixels and audio of an interactive session embed the necessary information required to detect affect. We test our hypothesis in the domain of digital games and evaluate the degree to which deep classifiers and deep preference learning algorithms can learn to predict the arousal of players based only on the video footage of their gameplay. Our results from four dissimilar games suggest that general-purpose representations can be built across games as the arousal models obtain average accuracies as high asusing the challenging leave-one-video-out cross-validation scheme. The dissimilar audiovisual characteristics of the tested games showcase the strengths and limitations of the proposed method.

In this paper, a novel XAI visual explanation algorithm known as theSimilarity Difference and Uniqueness(SIDU) method that can effectively localize entire object regions responsible for prediction is presented in full detail. The SIDU algorithm robustness and effectiveness is analyzed through various computational and human subject experiments. In particular, the SIDU algorithm is assessed using three different types of evaluations (Application, Human and Functionally-Grounded) to demonstrate its superior performance. The robustness of SIDU is further studied in the presence of adversarial attack on ’black-box’ models to better understand its performance.

We present the results of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observation inCO(1–0) emission at 0.580.52 pcresolution toward the brightest Hiiregion N66 of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). TheCO(1–0) emission toward the north of N66 reveals the clumpy filaments with multiple velocity components. Our analysis shows that a blueshifted filament at a velocity range 154.4–158.6 km sinteracts with a redshifted filament at a velocity 158.0–161.8 km s. A third velocity component in a velocity range 161–165.0 km sconstitutes hub-filaments. An intermediate-mass young stellar object (YSO) and a young pre-main sequence star cluster have hitherto been reported in the intersection of these filaments. We find a V-shape distribution in the position-velocity diagram at the intersection of two filaments. This indicates the physical association of those filaments due to a cloud-cloud collision. We determine the collision timescale0.2 Myr using the relative velocity (5.1 km s) and displacement (1.1 pc) of those interacting filaments. These results suggest that the event occurred at about 0.2 Myr ago and triggered the star formation, possibly an intermediate-mass YSO. We report the first observational evidence for a cloud–cloud collision that triggers star formation in N66N of the low metallicity0.2 Zgalaxy, the SMC, with similar kinematics as in N159W-South and N159E of the Large Magellanic Cloud.	galaxies: individual (SMC) — stars: formation

[2101.10714] Relieving the 𝐻₀ tension with a new interacting dark energy model	Li-Yang Gao Ze-Wei Zhao She-Sheng Xue Xin Zhang11footnotetext:Corresponding author.	footnotetext:		We investigate an extended cosmological model motivated by the asymptotic safety of gravitational field theory, in which the matter and radiation densities and the cosmological constant receive a correction parametrized by the parametersand, leading to that both the evolutions of the matter and radiation densities and the cosmological constant slightly deviate from the standard forms. Here we explain this model as a scenario of vacuum energy interacting with matter and radiation. We consider two cases of the model: (i)CDM with one additional free parameter, withandrelated by a low-redshift limit relation and (ii) eCDM with two additional free parametersandthat are independent of each other. We use two data combinations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) and CMB+BAO+SN+(CBSH), to constrain the models. We find that, in the case of using the CBS data, neitherCDM nor eCDM can effectively alleviate thetension. However, it is found that using the CBSH data thetension can be greatly relieved by the models. In particular, in the case of eCDM, thetension can be resolved to 0.71. We conclude that as an interacting dark energy model,CDM is much better thanCDM in the sense of both relieving thetension and fitting to the current observational data.

L Verdugo M Papaderos P Fogarty K Donahue M Postman M	institutetext:	ciocan.bianca-iulia@univie.ac.at	We reveal the importance of ongoing in-situ star formation in the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) in the massive cool-core CLASH cluster MACS 1931.8-2635 at a redshift of z=0.35 by analysing archival VLT-MUSE optical integral field spectroscopy. Using a multi-wavelength approach, we assess the stellar and warm ionized medium components, spatially resolved by the VLT-MUSE spectroscopy, and link them to the molecular gas by incorporating sub-mm ALMA observations.We measure the fluxes of strong emission lines such as:,,,,and, allowing us to determine the physical conditions of the warm ionized gas, such as electron temperature, electron density, extinction, ionization parameter, (O/H) gas metallicities, star formation rates and gas kinematics, as well as the star formation history of the system. Our analysis reveals the ionizing sources in different regions of the galaxy.The ionized gas flux brightness peak corresponds to the location of the supermassive black hole in the BCG and the system shows a diffuse warm ionized gas tail extending 30 kpc in N-E direction. The ionized and molecular gas are co-spatial and co-moving, with the gaseous component in the tail likely falling inward, providing fuel for star formation and accretion-powered nuclear activity. The gas is ionized by a mix of star formation and other energetic processes which give rise to LINER-like emission, with active galactic nuclei emission dominant only in the BCG core. We measure a star formation rate of, with its peak at the BCG core. However, star formation accounts for only 50-60% of the energetics needed to ionize the warm gas. In situ star formation generated by thermally unstable intracluster medium cooling and/or dry mergers dominate the stellar mass growth of the BCG at z¡0.5 and these mechanisms account for the build-up of 20% of the stellar mass of the system. Our measurements reveal that the most central regions of the BCG contain the lowest gas phase oxygen abundance whereas thearm exhibits slightly more elevated values, suggesting the transport of gas out to large distances from the centre due to active galactic nuclei outbursts. The galaxy is a dispersion dominated system, typical for massive, elliptical galaxies. The gas and stellar kinematics are decoupled, with the gaseous velocity fields being more closely related to the bulk motions of the intracluster medium.

[2101.10719] Short-term prediction of Time Series based on bounding techniques	Pedro Cadahía José M. Bravo		pedro.cadahia@alu.uhu.es	In this paper it is reconsidered the prediction problem in time series framework by using a new non-parametric approach. Through this reconsideration, the prediction is obtained by a weighted sum of past observed data. These weights are obtained by solving a constrained linear optimization problem that minimizes an outer bound of the prediction error. The innovation is to consider both deterministic and stochastic assumptions in order to obtain the upper bound of the prediction error, a tuning parameter is used to balance these deterministic-stochastic assumptions in order to improve the predictor performance. A benchmark is included to illustrate that the proposed predictor can obtain suitable results in a prediction scheme, and can be an interesting alternative method to the classical non-parametric methods. Besides, it is shown how this model can outperform the preexisting ones in a short term forecast.	Nonparametric methods | Nonlinear models | Optimization | Time series | Univariate predicting method

To foster social progress, it is important to develop models of the interaction between data producers and consumers that can promote the rise of cooperation between the involved parties. We formalize this interaction as a game, the data sharing game, based on the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma and deal with it through multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques. We consider several strategies for how the citizens may behave, depending on the degree of centralization sought. Simulations suggest mechanisms for cooperation to take place and, thus, achieve maximum social utility: data consumers should perform some kind of opponent modeling, or a regulator should transfer utility between both players and incentivise them.	data sharing; iterated prisoner’s dilemma; multi-agent reinforcement learning.

This paper proposes a two-lane model with extended Langmuir kinetics on a periodic lattice. Both bidirectional and unidirectional flows are investigated. In our model, the hopping, attachment, and detachment rates vary depending on the state of the corresponding site in the other lane. We obtain a theoretical expression for the global density of the system in the steady state from three kinds of mean-field analyses (1-, 2-, and 4-cluster cases). We verify that the 4-cluster mean-field analysis approximates well the results of computer simulations for the two directional flows and reproduces the differences between them. We expect these findings to contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic features of actual traffic systems.

However, keeping track of the constantly changing legislation is difficult, thus organizations are increasingly adopting Regulatory Technology (RegTech) to facilitate the process. To this end, we introduceregulatory information retrieval(reg-ir), an application ofdocument-to-document information retrieval(doc2docir), where the query is an entire document making the task more challenging than traditionalirwhere the queries are short. Furthermore, we compile and release two datasets based on the relationships betweeneudirectives anduklegislation. We experiment on these datasets using a typical two-step pipeline approach comprising a pre-fetcher and a neural re-ranker. Experimenting with various pre-fetchers frombmtonearest neighbors over representations from severalbertmodels, we show that fine-tuning abertmodel on an in-domain classification task produces the best representations forir. We also show that neural re-rankers under-perform due tocontradictingsupervision, i.e., similar query-document pairs with opposite labels. Thus, they are biased towards the pre-fetcher’s score. Interestingly, applying a date filter further improves the performance, showcasing the importance of the time dimension.

Based on deep images, Venhola and colleagues analysed correlations between colour and surface brightness for galaxies in the Fornax cluster binned by luminosity or stellar mass. In the bins with, the authors identified a correlation of redness with fainter surface brightness and interpreted it as a consequence of the quenching of star formation by ram pressure stripping in the dwarf galaxies.

We focus, in particular, on the case where anharmonicity is very strong and the system reduces to a qubit. In the latter case, we derive general upper bounds on rectification which hold in the weak system-bath coupling regime, and we show how the Lamb shift can be exploited to enhance rectification. We then go beyond the weak-coupling regime by employing different methods: i) including co-tunneling processes, ii) using the non-equilibrium Green’s function formalism and iii) using the Feynman-Vernon path integral approach. We find that the strong coupling regime allows us to violate the bounds derived in the weak-coupling regime, providing us with clear signatures of high order coherent processes visible in the thermal rectification. In the general case, where many levels participate to the system dynamics, we compare the heat rectification calculated with the equation of motion method and with a mean-field approximation. We find that the former method predicts, for a small or intermediate anharmonicity, a larger rectification coefficient.

We construct galaxy mock catalogues adopting a standard sub-halo abundance matching scheme coupled with a secondary assignment between galaxy colour or specific star formation rate and the following subhalo properties: starvation redshift z, concentration at infall, overdensity, tidal anisotropy, and tidal overdensity. The last two quantities allow us to fully characterise the tidal field of our subhaloes, acting as mediators between their internal and large-scale properties. The resulting mock catalogues overall return good agreement with the IllustrisTNG100 measurements. The accuracy of each model strongly depends on the correlation between the secondary galaxy and subhalo properties employed. Among all the subhalo proxies tested, we find that zandare the ones that best trace the large-scale structure, producing robust clustering predictions for different samples of red/blue and quenched/star-forming galaxies.	galaxies: formation — galaxies: haloes — galaxies: statistics — cosmology: observations — cosmology: theory — large-scale structure of Universe
[2101.10734] Consistent Mesh Colors for Multi-View Reconstructed 3D Scenes				We address the issue of creating consistent mesh texture maps captured from scenes without color calibration. We find that the method for aggregation of the multiple views is crucial for creating spatially consistent meshes without the need to explicitly optimize for spatial consistency. We compute a color prior from the cross-correlation of observable view faces and the faces per view to identify an optimal per-face color. We then use this color in a re-weighting ratio for the best-view texture, which is identified by prior mesh texturing work, to create a spatial consistent texture map. Despite our method not explicitly handling spatial consistency, our results show qualitatively more consistent results than other state-of-the-art techniques while being computationally more efficient. We evaluate on prior datasets and additionally Matterport3D showing qualitative improvements.

Considering that cellular networks offer wide area, high speed, and secure wireless connectivity, cellular-connected UAVs have been considered as an appealing solution to provide UAV connectivity with enhanced reliability, coverage, throughput, and security. Due to the nature of UAVs mobility, the throughput, reliability and End-to-End (E2E) delay of UAVs communication under various flight heights, video resolutions, and transmission frequencies remain unknown. To evaluate these parameters, we develop a cellular-connected UAV testbed based on the Long Term Evolution (LTE) network with its uplink video transmission and downlink control&command (CC) transmission. We also design algorithms for sending control signal and controlling UAV. The indoor experimental results provide fundamental insights for the cellular-connected UAV system design from the perspective of transmission frequency, adaptability, and link outage, respectively.

[2101.10737] Mining the Stars: Learning Quality Ratings with User-facing Explanations for Vacation Rentals	Anastasiia Kornilova Lucas Bernardi	Netherlands	lucas.bernardi@booking.com anastasiia.kornilova@booking.com	Online Travel Platforms are virtual two-sided marketplaces where guests search for accommodations and accommodation providers list their properties such as hotels and vacation rentals. The large majority of hotels are rated by official institutions with a number of stars indicating the quality of service they provide. It is a simple and effective mechanism that contributes to match supply with demand by helping guests to find options meeting their criteria and accommodation suppliers to market their product to the right segment directly impacting the number of transactions on the platform. Unfortunately, no similar rating system exists for the large majority of vacation rentals, making it difficult for guests to search and compare options and hard for vacation rentals suppliers to market their product effectively. In this work we describe a machine learned quality rating system for vacation rentals. The problem is challenging, mainly due to explainability requirements and the lack of ground truth. We present techniques to address these challenges and empirical evidence of their efficacy. Our system was successfully deployed and validated through Online Controlled Experiments performed in Booking.com, a large Online Travel Platform, and running for more than one year, impacting more than a million accommodations and millions of guests.	recommender systems; explainability; semi-supervised learning

[2101.10739] Dynamic prediction of time to event with survival curves	Jie Zhu Blanca Gallego		elliott.zhu@unsw.edu.au	With the ever-growing complexity of primary health care system, proactive patient failure management is an effective way to enhancing the availability of health care resource. One key enabler is the dynamic prediction of time-to-event outcomes. Conventional explanatory statistical approach lacks the capability of making precise individual level prediction, while the data adaptive binary predictors does not provide nominal survival curves for biologically plausible survival analysis. The purpose of this article is to elucidate that the knowledge of explanatory survival analysis can significantly enhance the current black-box data adaptive prediction models. We apply our recently developed counterfactual dynamic survival model (CDSM) to static and longitudinal observational data and testify that the inflection point of its estimated individual survival curves provides reliable prediction of the patient failure time.

[2101.10741] A Supernova-driven, Magnetically-collimated Outflow as the Origin of the Galactic Center Radio Bubbles	Mengfei Zhang Zhiyuan Li Mark R. Morris	School of Astronomy and Space Science Nanjing University Nanjing 210023 ChinaKey Laboratory of Modern Astronomy and Astrophysics (Nanjing University) Ministry of Education Nanjing 210023 	lizy@nju.edu.cn zmf@nju.edu.cn	A pair of non-thermal radio bubbles recently discovered in the inner few hundred parsecs of the Galactic center bears a close spatial association with elongated, thermal X-ray features called the X-ray chimneys. While their morphology, position, and orientation vividly point to an outflow from the Galactic center, the physical processes responsible for the outflow remain to be understood. We use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to test the hypothesis that the radio bubbles/X-ray chimneys are the manifestation of an energetic outflow driven by multiple core-collapsed supernovae in the nuclear stellar disk, where numerous massive stars are known to be present. Our simulations are run with different combinations of two main parameters, the supernova birth rate and the strength of a global magnetic field being vertically oriented with respect to the disk. The simulation results show that a hot gas outflow can naturally form and acquire a vertically elongated shape due to collimation by the magnetic pressure. In particular, the simulation with an initial magnetic field strength of 80G and a supernova rate of 1 kyrcan well reproduce the observed morphology, internal energy and X-ray luminosity of the bubbles after an evolutionary time of 330 kyr. On the other hand, a magnetic field strength of 200G gives rise to an overly elongated outflow that is inconsistent with the observed bubbles. The simulations also reveal that, inside the bubbles, mutual collisions between the shock waves of individual supernovae produce dense filaments of locally amplified magnetic field. Such filaments may account for a fraction of the synchrotron-emitting radio filaments known to exist in the Galactic center.

Interference alignment (IA) is a promising scheme to mitigate CCI in traditional communication systems. Due to the signal-dependent noise in MC systems, the traditional IA schemes are less useful in MC systems. In this paper, we propose a novel IA scheme in molecular interference channels (IFCs), based on the choice of releasing/sampling times. To cancel the aligned interference signals and reduce the signal dependent noise, we use molecular reaction in the proposed IA scheme. We obtain the feasible region for the releasing/sampling times in the proposed scheme. Further, we investigate the error performance of the proposed scheme. Our results show that the proposed IA scheme using reaction improves the performance significantly.††This work was supported in part by the Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) Research Grant on Nano-Network Communications and in part by the Research Center of Sharif University of Technology.††The authors are with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran (email: maryam.farahnak@ee.sharif.edu, mirmohseni@sharif.edu, mnasiri@sharif.edu).	
[2101.10746] The hybrid number of a ploidy profile	Katharina T. Huber and Liam J. Maher	School of Computing Sciences University of East Anglia Norwich of Computing Sciences University of East Anglia Norwich 	K.Huber@uea.ac.uk L.Maher@uea.ac.uk	Polyploidization, whereby an organism inherits multiple copies of the genome of their parents, is an important evolutionary event that has been observed in plants and animals. One way tostudy such eventsis in terms of the ploidy number of the species that make up a dataset of interest. It is therefore natural to ask: How much information about the evolutionary past ofthe set of species that forma dataset can be gleaned from the ploidy numbers of the species? To help answerthisquestion, we introduce and study the novel concept of a ploidy profile which allows us to formalizeitin terms of a multiplicity vector indexed by the species the datasetis comprised of. Using the framework of a phylogenetic network,we presenta closed formula for computingthehybrid number(i.e. the minimal number of polyploidization events required to explain a ploidy profile) of a large class of ploidy profiles. This formula relies on the construction of a certain phylogenetic network from the simplification sequence of a ploidy profile and the hybrid number of the ploidy profile with which this construction is initialized. Both of them can be computed easily in case the ploidy numbers that make up the ploidy profile are not too large. To help illustrate the applicability of our approach, we apply it to a simplified version of a publicly available Viola dataset.	1991 Mathematics Subject Classification:1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 05C05; 92D15
[2101.10747] TOWARDS UNIVERSAL PHYSICAL ATTACKS ON CASCADED CAMERA-LIDAR 3D OBJECT DETECTION MODELS				We propose a universal and physically realizable adversarial attack on a cascaded multi-modal deep learning network (DNN), in the context of self-driving cars. DNNs have achieved high performance in 3D object detection, but they are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. These attacks have been heavily investigated in the RGB image domain and more recently in the point cloud domain, but rarely in both domains simultaneously - a gap to be filled in this paper. We use a single 3D mesh and differentiable rendering to explore how perturbing the mesh’s geometry and texture can reduce the robustness of DNNs to adversarial attacks. We attack a prominent cascaded multi-modal DNN, the Frustum-Pointnet model. Using the popular KITTI benchmark, we showed that the proposed universal multi-modal attack was successful in reducing the model’s ability to detect a car by nearly 73%. This work can aid in the understanding of what the cascaded RGB-point cloud DNN learns and its vulnerability to adversarial attacks.	
[2101.10748] A probabilistic proof of Cooper&Frieze’s “First Visit Time Lemma”	Francesco Manzo Matteo Quattropani Elisabetta Scoppola	Dipartimento di Matematica e Fisca Università di Roma Tre Largo San Leonardo Murialdo 1 00146 Roma 	mquattropani@luiss.it scoppola@mat.uniroma3.it manzo.fra@gmail.com	In this short note we present an alternative proof of the so-calledFirst Visit Time Lemma(FVTL), originally presented by Cooper and Frieze in its first formulation in[21], and then used and refined in a list of papers by Cooper, Frieze and coauthors. We work in the original setting, considering a growing sequence of irreducible Markov chains onstates. We assume that the chain is rapidly mixing and with a stationary measure having no entry which is too small nor too large. Under these assumptions, the FVTL shows the exponential decay of the distribution of the hitting time of a given state—for the chain started at stationarity—up to a small multiplicative correction. While the proof of the FVTL presented by Cooper and Frieze is based on tools from complex analysis, and it requires an additional assumption on a generating function, we present a completely probabilistic proof, relying on the theory of quasi-stationary distributions and on strong-stationary times arguments. In addition, under the same set of assumptions, we provide some quantitative control on the Doob’s transform of the chain on the complement of the state.

Hussey Kamran Behnia	thanks:	kamran.behnia@espci.fr	We present a study of the thermoelectric (Seebeck and Nernst) response in heavily overdoped, non-superconducting LaSrCuO. In spite of the electron-like curvature of the Fermi surface, the Seebeck coefficient is positive at low temperatures. Such a feature, previously observed in copper, silver, gold and lithium, is caused by a non-trivial energy dependence of the scattering time. We argue that this feature implies a strong asymmetry between the lifetime of occupied and unoccupied states along the zone diagonals and such an electron-hole asymmetry impedes formation of Cooper pairs along the nodal direction in the superconducting ground state emerging at lower doping levels.

We perform a simultaneous analysis of the wide upper main sequence and main sequence turn-off observed in the cluster, to verify whether these features are due to an extended star formation or a range of stellar rotation rates, or a combination of these two effects. Comparing the observed CMD with Monte Carlo simulations of synthetic stellar populations, we derive that the morphology of NGC 1831 can be fully explained in the context of the rotation velocity scenario, under the assumption of a bimodal distribution for the rotating stars, with40% of stars being slow-rotators () and the remaining60% being fast rotators (). We derive the dynamical properties of the cluster, calculating the present cluster mass and escape velocity, and predicting their past evolution starting at an age of 10 Myr. We find that NGC 1831 has an escape velocitykm sat an age of 10 Myr, above the previously suggested threshold of 15 km sbelow which the cluster cannot retain the material needed to create second-generation stars. These results, combined with those obtained from the CMD morphology analysis, indicate that for the clusters whose morphology cannot be easily explained only in the context of the rotation velocity scenario, the threshold limit should be at least20 km s.	galaxies: star clusters — globular clusters: general — Magellanic Clouds

As a result, there has been a lot of focus in recent years on development and realization of separation architectures. Our study, however, shows that the energy savings of separation architecture remain underwhen compared with legacy systems and this gain falls to a merewhen both architectures are realized under a CloudRAN (CRAN) setting. Moreover, when we strategically place some small base-stations (SBSs) to cover the area in a densely deployed scenario and allow all other base-stations (BSs) to be used only on-demand, the system consumes much less energy than the separation architecture. While we expected that most equipment would be shut down during nights, our study shows that aroundof the small cells are required to be active to serve randomly distributed minimum data load, i.e., active mobile equipment. Contemporary mobile traffic is predominantly data which does not go to extremely low levels during nights. We discuss, in detail, the assumptions, their implications, and the effects of system parameter values on our conclusions.

It was confirmed that, as in the case of direct current, the possibility of a spin-Hall effect is associated with the presence of an imbalance of the spins and charges at the edges of the samples, which is realized using their asymmetric geometry. In particular, it was found that such chiral features of the nonequilibrium spin-Hall effect, such as independence from the direction of the injection current and the direction of the constant magnetic field, in the case of alternating current, make it possible to obtain a double-frequency transverse voltage, which can be used as a platform for creating spintronics devices.

In this paper, we propose an underlay spectrum sharing backscatter communication system, in which the secondary network is a backscatter communication system. We analyze the performance of the secondary network under a transmit power adaption strategy at the secondary transmitter, which guarantees that the interference caused by the secondary network to the primary receiver is below a predetermined threshold. We first derive a novel analytical expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio of the secondary network. Capitalizing on the obtained CDF, we derive novel accurate approximate expressions for the ergodic capacity, effective capacity and average bit error rate. We further validate our theoretical analysis using extensive Monte Carlo simulations.

The applied statistics used for randomness in WSNs are broad in nature, e.g., random deployment, activity tracking, packet generation, etc. Even though with adequate formal and informal information provided and pledge by authors, validation of the proposal became a challenging issue. The minuscule information alteration in implementation and validation can reflect the enormous effect on eventual results. In this proposal, we show how the results are affected by the generalized assumption made on randomness. In sensor node deployment, ambiguity arises due to node error-value (), and it’s upper bound in the relative position is estimated to understand the delicacy of diminutives changes. Moreover, the effect of uniformity in the traffic and contribution of scheduling position of nodes also generalized. We propose an algorithm to generate the unified dataset for the general and some specific applications system models in WSNs. The results produced by our algorithm reflects the pseudo-randomness and can efficiently regenerate through seed value for validation.

Instead of relying on hand-crafted aggregation schemes, we propose to explicitly learn this process with deep neural networks. We present a spatial pixel aggregation network and learn the pixel sampling and averaging strategies for image denoising. The proposed model naturally adapts to image structures and can effectively improve the denoised results. Furthermore, we develop a spatio-temporal pixel aggregation network for video denoising to efficiently sample pixels across the spatio-temporal space. Our method is able to solve the misalignment issues caused by large motion in dynamic scenes. In addition, we introduce a new regularization term for effectively training the proposed video denoising model. We present extensive analysis of the proposed method and demonstrate that our model performs favorably against the state-of-the-art image and video denoising approaches on both synthetic and real-world data.

[2101.10761] An Efficient Statistical-based Gradient Compression Technique for Distributed Training Systems		footnotetext:	marco@kaust.edu.sa	The recent many-fold increase in the size of deep neural networks makes efficient distributed training challenging. Many proposals exploit the compressibility of the gradients and propose lossy compression techniques to speed up the communication stage of distributed training. Nevertheless, compression comes at the cost of reduced model quality and extra computation overhead. In this work, we design an efficient compressor with minimal overhead. Noting the sparsity of the gradients, we propose to model the gradients as random variables distributed according to somesparsity-inducing distributions. We empirically validate our assumption by studying the statistical characteristics of the evolution of gradient vectors over the training process.

[2101.10762] Superfluid Quantum Criticality in Liquid ³He in Anisotropic Aerogel	Dai Nakashima and Ryusuke Ikeda	Department of Physics Graduate School of Science Kyoto University Kyoto 606-8502 Japan		In the novel superfluid polar phase realized in liquidHe in highly anisotropic aerogels, a quantum transition to the polar-distorted A (PdA) phase may occur at a low but finite pressure. It is shown that a nontrivial quantum dynamics of the critical fluctuation of the PdA order is induced by the presence of both the columnar-like impurity scattering leading to the Anderson’s Theorem for the polar phase and the line node of the quasiparticle gap in the state, and that, in contrast to the situation of the normal to the B-phase transition in isotropic aerogels, a weakly divergent behavior of the compressibility appears in the quantum critical region close to.

Following up on this, we investigate how ten invertible architectures and related models fare on two intuitive, low-dimensional benchmark problems, obtaining the best results with coupling layers and simple autoencoders. We hope that our initial efforts inspire other researchers to evaluate their invertible architectures in the same setting and put forth additional benchmarks, so our evaluation may eventually grow into an official community challenge.

[2101.10766] Automatic Detection of Causality in Requirement Artifacts: the CiRA Approach	Jannik Fischbach Julian Frattini Arjen Spaans Maximilian Kummeth Andreas Vogelsang Daniel Mendez Michael Unterkalmsteiner	institutetext:	mendez@fortiss.org vogelsang@cs.uni-koeln.de	[Context & motivation:] System behavior is often expressed by causal relations in requirements (e.g.,If event 1, then event 2). Automatically extracting this embedded causal knowledge supports not only reasoning about requirements dependencies, but also various automated engineering tasks such as seamless derivation of test cases. However, causality extraction from natural language (NL) is still an open research challenge as existing approaches fail to extract causality with reasonable performance. [Question/problem:] We understand causality extraction from requirements as a two-step problem: First, we need to detect if requirements have causal properties or not. Second, we need to understand and extract their causal relations. At present, though, we lack knowledge about the form and complexity of causality in requirements, which is necessary to develop a suitable approach addressing these two problems. [Principal ideas/results:] We conduct an exploratory case study with 14,983 sentences from 53 requirements documents originating from 18 different domains and shed light on the form and complexity of causality in requirements. Based on our findings, we develop a tool-supported approach for causality detection (CiRA, standing for Causality in Requirement Artifacts). This constitutes a first step towards causality extraction from NL requirements. [Contribution:] We report on a case study and the resulting tool-supported approach for causality detection in requirements. Our case study corroborates, among other things, that causality is, in fact, a widely used linguistic pattern to describe system behavior, as about a third of the analyzed sentences are causal. We further demonstrate that our tool CiRA achieves a macro-F1score of 82 % on real word data and that it outperforms related approaches with an average gain of 11.06 % in macro-Recall and 11.43 % in macro-Precision. Finally, we disclose our open data sets as well as our tool to foster the discourse on the automatic detection of causality in the RE community.

Ubertini	INAF - Istituto di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali via Fosso del Cavaliere 100 00133 Roma Italy		The microquasar MAXI Jwent into outburst from mid-March until mid-July 2018 with several faint rebrightenings afterwards. With a peak flux of approximately 4 Crab in thekeV, energy range the source was monitored across the electromagnetic spectrum with detections from radio to hard X-ray frequencies. Using these multi-wavelength observations, we analyzed quasi-simultaneous observations from 12 April, near the peak of the outburst (March). Spectral analysis of the hard X-rays found akeV andwith aCompTTmodel, indicative of an accreting black hole binary in the hard state. The flat/inverted radio spectrum and the accretion disk winds seen at optical wavelengths are also consistent with the hard state. Then we constructed a spectral energy distribution spanningorders of magnitude using modelling inJetSeT. The model is composed of an irradiated disk with a Compton hump and a leptonic jet with an acceleration region and a synchrotron-dominated cooling region.JetSeTfinds the spectrum is dominated by jet emission up to approximatelyHz after which disk and coronal emission dominate. The acceleration region has a magnetic field ofG, a cross section ofcm, and a flat radio spectral shape naturally obtained from the synchroton cooling of the accelerated electrons. The jet luminosity oferg/s () compared to an accretion luminosity oferg/s, assuming a distance of 3 kpc. Because these two values are comparable, it is possible the jet is powered predominately via accretion with only a small contribution needed from the Blanford-Znajek mechanism from the reportedly slowly spinning black hole.

For superconducting accelerators, it is an unwanted phenomena that we usually want to get rid off. The SPIRAL2 superconducting accelerator had distributed Taconis all over its cryostats. This paper spans the different steps from their first detection to their damping with a highlight on the methods and the instrumentation that has been used. The presented study also sets the ground for a real life experimental investigation of thermo-ascoustics in complex geometries such as superconducting LINACs. With modern Big data analysis and simulation tools, it also sets the ground for the developments of new data linked codes that fit these complex situations.

The fixed-disc problem occurs as a natural consequence of this problem. Our aim in this paper, is to investigate new classes of self-mappings which satisfy new specific type of contraction on a metric space. We see that the fixed point set of any member of these classes contains a circle (or a disc) called the fixed circle (resp. fixed disc) of the corresponding self-mapping. For this purpose, we introduce the notions of an-contractive mapping and an-expanding mapping. Activation functions with fixed circles (resp. fixed discs) are often seen in the study of neural networks. This shows the effectiveness of our fixed-circle (resp. fixed-disc) results. In this context, our theoretical results contribute to future studies on neural networks.	Key words and phrases:Fixed point | fixed circle | fixed disc.

Candidate events are selected using a dedicated high-multiplicity photonuclear event trigger, a combination of information from the zero-degree calorimeters and forward calorimeters, and from pseudorapidity gaps constructed using calorimeter energy clusters and charged-particle tracks. Distributions of event properties are compared between data and Monte Carlo simulations of photonuclear processes. Two-particle correlation functions are formed using charged-particle tracks in the selected events, and a template-fitting method is employed to subtract the non-flow contribution to the correlation. Significant nonzero values of the second- and third-order flow coefficients are observed and presented as a function of charged-particle multiplicity and transverse momentum. The results are compared with flow coefficients obtained in proton–proton and proton–lead collisions in similar multiplicity ranges, and with theoretical expectations. The unique initial conditions present in this measurement provide a new way to probe the origin of the collective signatures previously observed only in hadronic collisions.\AtlasRefCodeATLAS-HION-2018-027\PreprintIdNumberCERN-EP-2020-246\AtlasJournalPhys.

[2101.10772] LIGHTS: LIGHT Specularity Dataset for specular detection in Multi-view				Specular highlights are commonplace in images, however, methods for detecting them and in turn removing the phenomenon are particularly challenging. A reason for this, is due to the difficulty of creating a dataset for training or evaluation, as in the real-world we lack the necessary control over the environment. Therefore, we propose a novel physically-based rendered LIGHT Specularity (LIGHTS) Dataset for the evaluation of the specular highlight detection task. Our dataset consists ofhigh quality architectural scenes, where each scene is rendered with multiple views. In total we haveviews with an average ofviews per scene. Additionally we propose a simple aggregation based method for specular highlight detection that outperforms prior work byin two orders of magnitude less time on our dataset.	
[2101.10773] Data-driven design of a new class of rare-earth free permanent magnets	Alena Vishina Daniel Hedlund Vitalii Shtender Erna K. Delczeg-Czirjak Simon R. Larsen Olga Yu. Vekilova Shuo Huang Levente Vitos Peter Svedlindh Martin Sahlberg Olle Eriksson Heike C. Herper	Department of Physics and Astronomy Uppsala University Box 516 SE-75120 Uppsala 	alena.vishina@physics.uu.se	A new class of rare-earth-free permanent magnets is proposed. The parent compound of this class is CoMnGe, and its discovery is the result of first principles theory combined with experimental synthesis and characterisation. The theory is based on a high-throughput/data-mining search among materials listed in the ICSD database. From ab-initio theory of the defect free material it is predicted that the saturation magnetization is 1.71 T, the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy is 1.44 MJ/m, and the Curie temperature is 700 K. CoMnGe samples were then synthesized and characterised with respect to structure and magnetism. The crystal structure was found to be the MgZn-type, with partial disorder of Co and Ge on the crystallographic lattice sites. From magnetization measurements a saturation polarization of 0.86 T at 10 K was detected, together with a uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant of 1.18 MJ/m, and the Curie temperature of= 359 K. These magnetic properties make CoMnGe a very promising material as a rare-earth free permanent magnet, and since we can demonstrate that magnetism depends critically on the amount of disorder of the Co and Ge atoms, a further improvement of the magnetism is possible. From the theoretical works, a substitution of Ge by neighboring elements suggest two other promising materials - CoMnAl and CoMnGa. We demonstrate here that the class of compounds based onMnX (T = Co or alloys between Fe and Ni; X=Ge, Al or Ga) in the MgZnstructure type, form a new class of rare-earth free permanent magnets with very promising performance.	
[2101.10774] Lightweight Multi-Branch Network for Person Re-Identification				Person Re-Identification aims to retrieve person identities from images captured by multiple cameras or the same cameras in different time instances and locations. Because of its importance in many vision applications from surveillance to human-machine interaction, person re-identification methods need to be reliable and fast. While more and more deep architectures are proposed for increasing performance, those methods also increase overall model complexity. This paper proposes a lightweight network that combines global, part-based, and channel features in a unified multi-branch architecture that builds on the resource-efficient OSNet backbone. Using a well-founded combination of training techniques and design choices, our final model achieves state-of-the-art results on CUHK03 labeled, CUHK03 detected, and Market-1501 with 85.1% mAP / 87.2% rank1, 82.4% mAP / 84.9% rank1, and 91.5% mAP / 96.3% rank1, respectively.

With the rotation of the cameras we overcome the limitations of standard static systems that restrict the duration of the collected data to the short interval of time in which targets are in the cameras common field of view, but at the same time we change in time the external parameters of the system, which have then to be calibrated frame-by-frame. We address the calibration of the external parameters measuring the position of the cameras and their three angles of yaw, pitch and roll in the systemhomeconfiguration (rotational stage at an angle equal to) and combining this static information with the time dependent rotation due to the stages. We evaluate the robustness and accuracy of the system by comparing reconstructed and measureddistances in what we calltests, which show a relative error of the order of. The novelty of the work presented in this paper is not only on the system itself, but also on the approach we use in the tests, which we show to be a very powerful tool in detecting and fixing calibration inaccuracies and that, for this reason, may be relevant for a broad audience.	
[2101.10776] The radiative efficiency of neutron stars at low-level accretion	Erlin Qiaoand B.F. LiuKey Laboratory of Space Astronomy and Technology, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, ChinaSchool of Astronomy and Space Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China	E-mail:	qiaoel@nao.cas.cn	When neutrons star low-mass X-ray binaries (NS-LMXBs) are in the low-level accretion regime (i.e.,), the accretion flow in the inner region around the NS is expected to be existed in the form of the hot accretion flow, e.g., the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) as that in black hole X-ray binaries. Following our previous studies in Qiao & Liu 2020a and 2020b on the ADAF accretion around NSs, in this paper, we investigate the radiative efficiency of NSs with an ADAF accretion in detail, showing that the radiative efficiency of NSs with an ADAF accretion is much lower than that ofdespite the existence of the hard surface. As a result, given a X-ray luminosity(e.g., between 0.5 and 10 keV),calculated byis lower than the realcalculated within the framework of the ADAF accretion. The realcan be more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of calculated bywith appropriate model parameters. Finally, we discuss that if applicable, the model of ADAF accretion around a NS can be applied to explain the observed millisecond X-ray pulsation in some NS-LMXBs (such as PSR J1023+0038, XSS J12270-4859 and IGR J17379-3747) at a lower X-ray luminosity of a few times of, since at this X-ray luminosity the calculatedwith the model of ADAF accretion can be high enough to drive a fraction of the matter in the accretion flow to be channelled onto the surface of the NS forming the X-ray pulsation.	accretion | accretion discs – stars: neutron – black hole physics – X-rays: binaries

Josip Šarić Sacha Vražić Siniša Šegvić Josip Šarić Sacha Vražić Siniša Šegvić	thanks:	sacha.vrazic@rimac-automobili.com	Dense semantic forecasting anticipates future events in video by inferring pixel-level semantics of an unobserved future image. We present a novel approach that is applicable to various single-frame architectures and tasks. Our approach consists of two modules. Feature-to-motion (F2M) module forecasts a dense deformation field that warps past features into their future positions. Feature-to-feature (F2F) module regresses the future features directly and is therefore able to account for emergent scenery. The compound F2MF model decouples the effects of motion from the effects of novelty in a task-agnostic manner. We aim to apply F2MF forecasting to the most subsampled and the most abstract representation of a desired single-frame model. Our design takes advantage of deformable convolutions and spatial correlation coefficients across neighbouring time instants. We perform experiments on three dense prediction tasks: semantic segmentation, instance-level segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. The results reveal state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across three dense prediction tasks.	dense semantic forecasting | future prediction | computer vision | deep learning

We first generalise, to the continuous variable regime, the seminal results by Buscemi [PRL 108, 200401 (2012)] and Branciardet al.[PRL 110, 060405 (2013)], showing that all entangled states can be detected in this scenario. Most importantly, we then describe a practical protocol that allows for the measurement-device-independent certification of entanglement of all two-mode entangled Gaussian states. This protocol is feasible with current technology as it makes only use of standard optical setups such as coherent states and homodyne measurements.

Chang	$^⋆$: Equal contribution	darrick.chang@icfo.eu phzhou@fudan.edu.cn saijunwu@fudan.edu.cn	Quantum light-matter interfaces, based upon ensembles of cold atoms or other quantum emitters, are a vital platform for diverse quantum technologies and the exploration of fundamental quantum phenomena. Most of our understanding and modeling of such systems are based upon macroscopic theories, wherein the atoms are treated as a smooth, quantum polarizable medium. Although it is known that such approaches ignore a number of microscopic details, such as the granularity of atoms, dipole-dipole interactions and multiple scattering of light, the consequences of such effects in practical settings are usually mixed with background macroscopic effects and difficult to quantify. In this work we demonstrate a time-domain method to measure microscopically-driven optical effects in a background-free fashion, by transiently suppressing the macroscopic dynamics. With the method, we reveal a microscopic dipolar dephasing mechanism that generally limits the lifetime of the optical spin-wave order in a random gas. Theoretically, we show the dephasing effect emerges from the strong resonant dipole interaction between close-by atomic pairs.

There are some indications that the-rays detected with HAWC were produced by cosmic ray protons or nuclei colliding with the ambient gas. Assuming primary protons, we inquire which shape of the primary proton spectrum is compatible with the HAWC measurements. We find that the primary proton spectrum with the power-law shape ofand the cutoff energyTeV describes the data well. However, much harder spectra withdown to 1.3 andas low as 200 TeV also do not contradict the HAWC measurements. The former option might be realized if the accelerator is inside or very near to the-ray production zone. The latter option is viable for the case of a cosmic ray source which effectively confines low-energy (TeV) accelerated protons. Using publicly-available data of the Fermi-LAT space-ray telescope, we derive upper limits on the intensity of theHAWC J1825-134 (catalog )source in the 1 GeV – 1 TeV energy range. We show that the account of these upper limits drastically changes the interpretation: only hard () spectra describe the combined HAWC and Fermi-LAT datasets well.

However, social media significantly contribute also to fast spreading biased and false news while targeting specific segments of the population. We have seen how false information can be spread using automated accounts, known as bots. Using Twitter as a benchmark, we investigate behavioural attitudes of so called ‘credulous’ users, i.e., genuine accounts following many bots. Leveraging our previous work, where supervised learning is successfully applied to single out credulous users, we improve the classification task with a detailed features’ analysis and provide evidence that simple and lightweight features are crucial to detect such users. Furthermore, we study the differences in the way credulous and not credulous users interact with bots and discover that credulous users tend to amplify more the content posted by bots and argue that their detection can be instrumental to get useful information on possible dissemination of spam content, propaganda, and, in general, little or no reliable information.

Amr Alanwar, Alexander Berndt, Karl Henrik Johansson, and Henrik Sandberg	thanks:	a.alanwar@jacobs-university.de	We propose a method to perform set-based state estimation of an unknown dynamical linear system using a data-driven set propagation function. Our method comes with set-containment guarantees, making it applicable to safety-critical systems. The method consists of two phases: (1) an offline learning phase where we collect noisy input-output data to determine a function to propagate the state-set ahead in time; and (2) an online estimation phase consisting of a time update and a measurement update. It is assumed that known finite sets bound measurement noise and disturbances, but we assume no knowledge of their statistical properties. These sets are described using zonotopes, allowing efficient propagation and intersection operations. We propose a new approach to compute a set of models consistent with the data and noise-bound, given input-output data in the offline phase. The set of models is utilized in replacing the unknown dynamics in the data-driven set propagation function in the online phase. Then, we propose two approaches to perform the measurement update. Simulations show that the proposed estimator yields state sets comparable in volume to theconfidence bounds obtained by a Kalman filter approach, but with the addition of state set-containment guarantees. We observe that using constrained zonotopes yields smaller sets but with higher computational costs than unconstrained ones.

We discuss a general hydrodynamic model governing the dynamics of a two-dimensional electron gas in a magnetized field-effect transistor in the slow drift regime. The Dyakonov–Shur instability is investigated, including the effect of weak magnetic fields (i.e. away from Landau levels). We show that the gap on the dispersion relation prevents the instability from reaching the lower frequencies, thus imposing a limit on the Mach number of the electronic flow. Furthermore, we discuss that the presence of the external magnetic field decreases the growth rate of the instability, as well as the saturation amplitude. The numerical results from our simulations and the presented higher order dynamic mode decomposition support such reasoning.

Like in photonic lasers, phonon lasing normally occurs in a single mechanical mode. We show here that phase-locked, multimode phonon lasing can be established in a multimode optomechanical system through Floquet dynamics induced by a temporally modulated laser drive. We demonstrate this concept in a suitably engineered silicon photonic nanocavity coupled to multiple GHz-frequency mechanical modes. We find that the long-term frequency stability is significantly improved in the multimode lasing state as a result of the phase locking. These results provide a path towards highly stable ultra-compact oscillators, pulsed phonon lasing, coherent waveform synthesis, and emergent many-mode phenomena in oscillator arrays.

Customer satisfaction with airlines and airport performance is considerably influenced by how much flights are delayed. But how should the delay be quantified with thousands of flights for each airport and airline? Here, we present a statistical analysis of arrival delays at several UK airports between 2018 and 2020. We establish a procedure to compare both mean delay and extreme events among airlines and airports, identifying a power-law decay of large delays. Furthermore, we note drastic changes in plane delay statistics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we find that delays are described by a superposition of simple distributions, leading to a superstatistics.

The latter uses large pre-trained models as feature extractors and enables the design of complex, non-linear models even on tiny datasets. Combining these two approaches is an effective, state-of-the-art method when dealing with small datasets.

When a superconductor exchanges unpaired electrons with a quantum dot, its gap is populated by a pair of electron-hole symmetric Yu-Shiba-Rusinov excitations between doublet and singlet many-body states. The fate of these excitations in the presence of a strong Coulomb repulsion in the superconductor is unknown, but of importance in applications such as topological superconducting qubits and multi-channel impurity models. Here we couple a quantum dot to a superconducting island with a tunable Coulomb repulsion. We show that a strong Coulomb repulsion changes the singlet many-body state into a two-body state. It also breaks the electron-hole energy symmetry of the excitations, which thereby lose their Yu-Shiba-Rusinov character.

We also show that the derived categoryis generated, as a triangulated category with coproducts, by the projective generator of. For a Grothendieck abelian category, we construct the injective derived and coderived model structures on complexes. Assuming Vopěnka’s principle, we prove that the derived categoryis generated, as a triangulated category with products, by the injective cogenerator of. More generally, we define the notion of an exact category with an object size function and prove that the derived category of any such exact category with exact-directed colimits of chains of admissible monomorphisms has Hom sets. In particular, the derived category of any locally presentable abelian category has Hom sets.	
[2101.10798] Mirror Chern numbers in the hybrid Wannier representation	Tomáš Rauch Thomas Olsen David Vanderbilt Ivo Souza	Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena 07743 Jena Germany		The topology of electronic states in band insulators with mirror symmetry can be classified in two different ways. One is in terms of the mirror Chern number, an integer that counts the number of protected Dirac cones in the Brillouin zone of high-symmetry surfaces. The other is via aindex that distinguishes between systems that have a nonzero quantized orbital magnetoelectric coupling (“axion-odd”), and those that do not (“axion-even”); this classification can also be induced by other symmetries in the magnetic point group, including time reversal and inversion. A systematic characterization of the axiontopology has previously been obtained by representing the valence states in terms of hybrid Wannier functions localized along one chosen crystallographic direction, and inspecting the associated Wannier band structure. Here we focus on mirror symmetry, and extend that characterization to the mirror Chern number. We choose the direction orthogonal to the mirror plane as the Wannierization direction, and show that the mirror Chern number can be determined from the winding numbers of the touching points between Wannier bands on mirror-invariant planes, and from the Chern numbers of flat bands pinned to those planes. In this representation, the relation between the mirror Chern number and the axionindex is readily established. The formalism is illustrated by means ofab initiocalculations for SnTe in the monolayer and bulk forms, complemented by tight-binding calculations for a toy model.	
[2101.10799] ImageCHD: A 3D Computed Tomography Image Dataset for Classification of Congenital Heart Disease	Xiaowei Xu Tianchen Wang Jian Zhuang Haiyun Yuan Meiping Huang Jianzheng Cen Qianjun Jia Yuhao Dong Yiyu Shi	institutetext:	xiao.wei.xu@foxmail.com zhuangjian5413@tom.com huangmeiping@126.com	Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of birth defects, which occurs 1 in every 110 births in the United States. CHD usually comes with severe variations in heart structure and great artery connections that can be classified into many types. Thus highly specialized domain knowledge and time-consuming human process is needed to analyze the associated medical images. On the other hand, due to the complexity of CHD and the lack of dataset, little has been explored on the automatic diagnosis (classification) of CHDs. In this paper, we present ImageCHD, the first medical image dataset for CHD classification. ImageCHD contains 110 3D Computed Tomography (CT) images covering most types of CHD, which is of decent size compared with existing medical imaging datasets. Classification of CHDs requires the identification of large structural changes without any local tissue changes, with limited data. It is an example of a larger class of problems that are quite difficult for current machine-learning based vision methods to solve. To demonstrate this, we further present a baseline framework for automatic classification of CHD, based on a state-of-the-art CHD segmentation method. Experimental results show that the baseline framework can only achieve a classification accuracy of 81.9% under selective prediction scheme with 88.8% coverage, leaving big room for further improvement. We hope that ImageCHD can stimulate further research and lead to innovative and generic solutions that would have an impact in multiple domains. Our dataset is released to the public[1].

[2101.10800] Robust Scheduling of Virtual Power Plant under Exogenous and Endogenous Uncertainties	Yunfan Zhang, Feng Liu, Zhaojian Wang, Yifan Su, Weisheng Wang, and Shuanglei Feng			Virtual power plant (VPP) provides a flexible solution to distributed energy resources integration by aggregating renewable generation units, conventional power plants, energy storages, and flexible demands. This paper proposes a novel model for determining the optimal offering strategy in the day-ahead energy-reserve market and the optimal self-scheduling plan. It considers exogenous uncertainties (or called decision-independent uncertainties, DIUs) associated with market clearing prices and available wind power generation, as well as the endogenous uncertainties (or called decision-dependent uncertainties, DDUs) pertaining to real-time reserve deployment requests. A tractable solution method based on strong duality theory, McCormick relaxation, and the Benders’ decomposition to solve the proposed stochastic adaptive robust optimization with DDUs formulation is developed. Simulation results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.	Adaptive robust optimization | decision dependent uncertainty | endogenous uncertainty | virtual power plant
[2101.10801] Global-Local Propagation Network for RGB-D Semantic Segmentation				Depth information matters in RGB-D semantic segmentation task for providing additional geometric information to color images. Most existing methods exploit a multi-stage fusion strategy to propagate depth feature to the RGB branch. However, at the very deep stage, the propagation in a simple element-wise addition manner can not fully utilize the depth information. We propose Global-Local propagation network (GLPNet) to solve this problem. Specifically, a local context fusion module(L-CFM) is introduced to dynamically align both modalities before element-wise fusion, and a global context fusion module(G-CFM) is introduced to propagate the depth information to the RGB branch by jointly modeling the multi-modal global context features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and complementarity of the proposed fusion modules. Embedding two fusion modules into a two-stream encoder-decoder structure, our GLPNet achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two challenging indoor scene segmentation datasets, i.e., NYU-Depth v2 and SUN-RGBD dataset.

The first case concerns the dynamics of a fluid with an unspecified barotropic equation of state (EoS), for which the only assumption made is the non-negativity of the fluidâs energy density. The second case concerns the dynamics of a non-minimally coupled real scalar field with unspecified positive potential. For each of these models, we define a new set of dimensionless variables and a new evolution parameter. In the framework of these agnostic setups, we are able to identify several general features, like symmetries, invariant subsets and critical points, and provide their cosmological interpretation.

[2101.10803] ACAV100M: Automatic Curation of Large-Scale Datasets for Audio-Visual Video Representation Learning	Sangho Lee11footnotemark:1, Jiwan Chung11footnotemark:1, Youngjae Yu, Gunhee KimSeoul National University Thomas Breuel, Gal ChechikNVIDIA Research Yale SongMicrosoft Research https://acav100m.github.io	footnotemark:		The natural association between visual observations and their corresponding sound provides powerful self-supervisory signals for learning video representations, which makes the ever-growing amount of online videos an attractive source of training data. However, large portions of online videos contain irrelevant audio-visual signals because of edited/overdubbed audio, and models trained on such uncurated videos have shown to learn suboptimal representations. Therefore, existing approaches rely almost exclusively on datasets with predetermined taxonomies of semantic concepts, where there is a high chance of audio-visual correspondence. Unfortunately, constructing such datasets require labor intensive manual annotation and/or verification, which severely limits the utility of online videos for large-scale learning. In this work, we present an automatic dataset curation approach based on subset optimization where the objective is to maximize the mutual information between audio and visual channels in videos. We demonstrate that our approach finds videos with high audio-visual correspondence and show that self-supervised models trained on our data achieve competitive performances compared to models trained on existing manually curated datasets. The most significant benefit of our approach is scalability: We release ACAV100M that contains 100 million videos with high audio-visual correspondence, ideal for self-supervised video representation learning.	
[2101.10804] CPTR: Full Transformer Network for Image Captioning				In this paper, we consider the image captioning task from a new sequence-to-sequence prediction perspective and propose CaPtion TransformeR (CPTR) which takes the sequentialized raw images as the input to Transformer. Compared to the “CNN+Transformer” design paradigm, our model can model global context at every encoder layer from the beginning and is totally convolution-free. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and we surpass the conventional “CNN+Transformer” methods on the MSCOCO dataset. Besides, we provide detailed visualizations of the self-attention between patches in the encoder and the “words-to-patches” attention in the decoder thanks to the full Transformer architecture.	
[2101.10805] Max-Plus Opinion Dynamics With Temporal Confidence	Daniel Feinstein Ebrahim Patel	institutetext:	danielfeinstein12@gmail.com	Often in the setting of human-based interactions, the existence of a temporal hierarchy of information plays an important role in diffusion and opinion dynamics within communities[1]. For example at the individual agent level, more recently acquired information may exert greater influence during decision-making processes[2]. To facilitate further exploration of this effect, we introduce an efficient method for modelling temporally asynchronous opinion updates, where the timing of updates depends on the timing of incoming opinion states received from neighbours. The framework enables the introduction ofinformation arrival-time lagby means oflag-vectors. These are used to weight the relevance of information received by agents, based on the delay between its receipt and the subsequent opinion update. The temporal dynamics (i.e. the times at which information is transmitted) are governed by an underlying algebraic structure called max-plus algebra ([3],[4]). We investigate the resulting continuous opinion dynamics under the max-plus regime using a modified Hegselmann-Krause model[5], replacing the conventional confidence-interval based on the distance between opinions with one based instead on the recency of information received by agents.Our model works as follows: at time-step, each agent (represented by a node in a network) is assigned an initial opinion from the intervaluniformly at random and transmits this value to all neighbours in the network. If an edge from agenttoexists, the information leaving agentarrives ataftertime units (e.g. minutes), whereis the max-plus adjacency matrix (which is nothing more than the transpose of the conventional adjacency matrix). After sending their current opinion, each agent enters a dormant period where it waits to receive all incoming opinion values. Once received, agents update their opinions before immediately re-sending their new values to all neighbours (possibly at different times), and this process continues for a desired duration.The event-times (the times at which opinion updates occur) can be conveniently modelled using the max-plus algebra which we denote. Letdenote the vector of thetime agents communicate their opinions. Thenis the time of thetransmission of agentand is defined, in line with the above description, by:

Under the framework of a constituent quark model, we quantitatively explain why such interesting phenomenon happens, when these established excited heavy baryons are regarded as the-mode excitations. Based on the universal behaviors of the discussed mass gaps, we may have three implications including the prediction of the masses of excitedbaryons which are still missing in the experiment. For completeness, we also discuss the mass gaps of these-mode excited single heavy flavor baryons.

[2101.10809] Exploring Transfer Learning on Face Recognition of Dark Skinned, Low Quality and Low Resource Face Data	Nuredin AliDepartment of Information SystemsMekelle		nuredi2000@gmail.com	There is a big difference in the tone of color of skin between dark and light skinned people. Despite this fact, most face recognition tasks almost all classical state-of-the-art models are trained on datasets containing an overwhelming majority of light skinned face images. It is tedious to collect a huge amount of data for dark skinned faces and train a model from scratch. In this paper, we apply transfer learning on VGGFace to check how it works on recognising dark skinned mainly Ethiopian faces. The dataset is of low quality and low resource. Our experimental results show above 95% accuracy which indicates that transfer learning in such settings works.

[2101.10811] Semi-synthesis: A fast way to produce effective datasets for stereo matching	Ju HeEnyu ZhouLiusheng SunFei LeiChenyang LiuWenxiu SunJohns Hopkins UniversitySenseTime Research	footnotetext:		Stereo matching is an important problem in computer vision which has drawn tremendous research attention for decades. Recent years, data-driven methods with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are continuously pushing stereo matching to new heights. However, data-driven methods require large amount of training data, which is not an easy task for real stereo data due to the annotation difficulties of per-pixel ground-truth disparity. Though synthetic dataset is proposed to fill the gaps of large data demand, the fine-tuning on real dataset is still needed due to the domain variances between synthetic data and real data. In this paper, we found that in synthetic datasets, close-to-real-scene texture rendering is a key factor to boost up stereo matching performance, while close-to-real-scene 3D modeling is less important. We then propose semi-synthetic, an effective and fast way to synthesize large amount of data with close-to-real-scene texture to minimize the gap between synthetic data and real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained with our proposed semi-synthetic datasets achieve significantly better performance than with general synthetic datasets, especially on real data benchmarks with limited training data. With further fine-tuning on the real dataset, we also achieve SOTA performance on Middlebury and competitive results on KITTI and ETH3D datasets.

CarterCarnegie Mellon UniversityPittsburgh PA			One challenge with introducing robots into novel environments is misalignment between supervisor expectations and reality, which can greatly affect a user’s trust and continued use of the robot. We performed an experiment to test whether the presence of an explanation of expected robot behavior affected a supervisor’s trust in an autonomous robot. We measured trust both subjectively through surveys and objectively through a dual-task experiment design to capture supervisors’ neglect tolerance (i.e., their willingness to perform their own task while the robot is acting autonomously). Our objective results show that explanations can help counteract the novelty effect of seeing a new robot perform in an unknown environment. Participants who received an explanation of the robot’s behavior were more likely to focus on their own task at the risk of neglecting their robot supervision task during the first trials of the robot’s behavior compared to those who did not receive an explanation. However, this effect diminished after seeing multiple trials, and participants who received explanations were equally trusting of the robot’s behavior as those who did not receive explanations. Interestingly, participants were not able to identify their own changes in trust through their survey responses, demonstrating that the dual-task design measured subtler changes in a supervisor’s trust.

A Study on Trust and Theory of Mind in Human-Robot Interactions	Wenxuan Mou*, Martina Ruocco*, Debora Zanattoand Angelo CangelosiDepartment of Computer Science, University of Manchester, UKDepartment of Computer Science, University of Bristol, UK	*for equal contributions in an alphabetical order.		Trust is a critical issue in human–robot interactions (HRI) as it is the core of human desire to accept and use a non-human agent. Theory of Mind (ToM) has been defined as the ability to understand the beliefs and intentions of others that may differ from one’s own. Evidences in psychology and HRI suggest that trust and ToM are interconnected and interdependent concepts, as the decision to trust another agent must depend on our own representation of this entity’s actions, beliefs and intentions. However, very few works take ToM of the robot into consideration while studying trust in HRI. In this paper, we investigated whether the exposure to the ToM abilities of a robot could affect humans’ trust towards the robot. To this end, participants played a Price Game with a humanoid robot (Pepper) that was presented having eitherlow-level ToMorhigh-level ToM. Specifically, the participants were asked to accept the price evaluations on common objects presented by the robot. The willingness of the participants to change their own price judgement of the objects (i.e., accept the price the robot suggested) was used as the main measurement of the trust towards the robot. Our experimental results showed that robots possessing a high-level of ToM abilities were trusted more than the robots presented with low-level ToM skills.

It arises from many applications, such as the image feature extraction problem and the multi-view clustering problem. We may symmetrize a T-square tensor to a T-symmetric tensor. For each T-square tensor, we define a T-quadratic form, whose variable is anmatrix, and whose value is a-dimensional vector. We define eigentuples and eigenmatrices for T-square tensors. We show that a T-symmetric tensor has unique largest and smallest eigentuples, and a T-quadratic form is positive semi-definite (definite) if and only if its smallest eigentuple is nonnegative (positive). The relation between the eigen-decomposition of T-symmetric tensors, and the TSVD of general third order tensors are also studied.	Key words.

Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences JD Block Sector-III Salt Lake City Kolkata 700 106 IndiaSchool of Physics Trinity College Dublin Dublin Ireland.Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology Kolkata India.	t.sahadasgupta@gmail.com	Understanding magnetism in multiple magnetic sublattice system, driven by the interplay of varied nature of magnetic exchanges, is on one hand challenging and on other hand intriguing. Motivated by the recent synthesis of AABBOdouble double perovskites with multiple magnetic ions both at A- and B-sites, we investigate the mechanism of magnetic behavior in these interesting class of compounds. We find that the magnetism in such multiple sublattice compounds is governed by the interplay and delicate balance between two distinct mechanisms, a) kinetic energy-driven multiple sublattice double exchange mechanism and b) the conventional super-exchange mechanism. The derived spin Hamiltonian based on first-principles calculations is solved by classical Monte Carlo technique which reproduces the observed magnetic properties. Finally, the influence of off-stoichiometry, as in experimental samples, is discussed. Some of these double double perovskite compounds are found to possess large total magnetic moment and also are found to be half-metallic, which raises the hope of future applications of these large magnetic moment half-metallic oxides in spintronics and memory devices.	pacs:75.50.-y | 71.20.-b | 75.10.Dg

[2101.10824] 1 Introduction				Human societies are characterized, besides others, by three constituent features. (A) Options, as for jobs and societal positions, differ with respect to their associated monetary and non-monetary payoffs. (B) Competition leads to reduced payoffs when individuals compete for the same option with others. (C) People care how they are doing relatively to others. The latter trait, the propensity to compare one’s own success with that of others, expresses itself as envy.It is shown that the combination of (A)-(C) leads to spontaneous class stratification. Societies of agents split endogenously into two social classes, an upper and a lower class, when envy becomes relevant. A comprehensive analysis of the Nash equilibria characterizing a basic reference game is presented. Class separation is due to the condensation of the strategies of lower-class agents, which play an identical mixed strategy. Upper class agents do not condense, following individualist pure strategies.Model and results are size-consistent, holding for arbitrary large numbers of agents and options. Analytic results are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations. An analogy to interacting confined classical particles is discussed.

Camilla Colombo222Associate Professor, Department of Aerospace Science and Technology, via La Masa 34, 20156, Milan, Italy.	Polytechnic of Milan Milan 20133 Italy		This work proposes a continuum-based approach for the propagation of uncertainties in the initial conditions and parameters for the analysis and prediction of spacecraft re-entries. Using the continuity equation together with the re-entry dynamics, the joint probability distribution of the uncertainties is propagated in time for specific sampled points. At each time instant, the joint probability distribution function is then reconstructed from the scattered data using a gradient-enhanced linear interpolation based on a simplicial representation of the state space. Uncertainties in the initial conditions at re-entry and in the ballistic coefficient for three representative test cases are considered: a three-state and a six-state steep Earth re-entry and a six-state unguided lifting entry at Mars. The paper shows the comparison of the proposed method with Monte Carlo based techniques in terms of quality of the obtained marginal distributions and runtime as a function of the number of samples used.

[2101.10829] Para-abelian varieties and Albanese maps	Bruno Laurent Stefan Schröer	Mathematisches Institut Heinrich-Heine-Universität 40204 Düsseldorf 	schroeer@math.uni-duesseldorf.de bruno.laurent@hhu.de	We construct for every proper algebraic space over a ground field an Albanese map to a para-abelian variety, which is unique up to unique isomorphism. This holds in the absence of rational points or ample sheaves, and also for reducible or non-reduced spaces, under the mere assumption that the structure morphism is in Stein factorization. It also works under suitable assumptions in families. In fact the treatment of the relative setting is crucial, even to understand the situation over ground fields. This also ensures that Albanese maps are equivariant with respect to actions of group schemes. Our approach depends on the notion of families of para-abelian varieties, where each geometric fiber admits the structure of an abelian variety, and representability of tau-parts in relative Picard groups, together with structure results on algebraic groups.	2010 Mathematics Subject Classification:14K30 | 14A20 | 14L30 | 14D10

[2101.10832] Revisiting Locally Supervised Learning: an Alternative to End-to-end Training	Yulin Wang, Zanlin Ni, Shiji Song, Le Yang & Gao HuangDepartment of Automation, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China,{wang-yl19, nzl17,	Corresponding author.		Due to the need to store the intermediate activations for back-propagation, end-to-end (E2E) training of deep networks usually suffers from high GPUs memory footprint. This paper aims to address this problem by revisiting the locally supervised learning, where a network is split into gradient-isolated modules and trained with local supervision. We experimentally show that simply training local modules with E2E loss tends to collapse task-relevant information at early layers, and hence hurts the performance of the full model. To avoid this issue, we propose an information propagation (InfoPro) loss, which encourages local modules to preserve as much useful information as possible, while progressively discard task-irrelevant information. As InfoPro loss is difficult to compute in its original form, we derive a feasible upper bound as a surrogate optimization objective, yielding a simple but effective algorithm. In fact, we show that the proposed method boils down to minimizing the combination of a reconstruction loss and a normal cross-entropy/contrastive term. Extensive empirical results on five datasets (i.e., CIFAR, SVHN, STL-10, ImageNet and Cityscapes) validate that InfoPro is capable of achieving competitive performance with less than 40% memory footprint compared to E2E training, while allowing using training data with higher-resolution or larger batch sizes under the same GPU memory constraint. Our method also enables training local modules asynchronously for potential training acceleration. Code is available at:https://github.com/blackfeather-wang/InfoPro-Pytorch.

Since its advent, it has been steadily utilizing the emerging technologies to improve accuracy, and machine learning has been at the heart of that. Machine learning has been increasingly used in fingerprint-based indoor localization to replace or emulate the radio map that is used to predict locations given a location signature. The prediction quality of a machine learning model primarily depends on how well the model was trained, which relies on the amount and quality of data used to train it. Data augmentation has been used to improve quality of the trained models by synthetically producing more training data, and several approaches were used in the literature that tackles the problem of lack of training data from different angles. In this paper, we propose DataLoc+, a data augmentation technique for room-level indoor localization that combines different approaches in a simple algorithm. We evaluate the technique by comparing it to the typical direct snapshot approach using data collected from a field experiment conducted in a hospital. Our evaluation shows that the model trained using the proposed technique achieves higher accuracy. We also show that the technique adapts to larger problems using a limited dataset while maintaining high accuracy.	Machine Learning | Indoor Localization | Room-level | Data Augmentation

Ji	institutetext:		The soft gamma-ray repeater candidateSGR~0755$-$2933was discovered in 2016 bySwift/BAT, which detected a short (ms) powerful burst typical of magnetars. To understand the nature of the source, we present here an analysis of follow-up observations of the tentative soft X-ray counterpart of the source obtained withSwift/XRT,NuSTARandChandra. From our analysis we conclude that, based on the observed counterpart position and properties, it is actually not a soft gamma ray repeater but rather a new high mass X-ray binary. We suggest to refer to it as 2SXPS J075542.5293353. We conclude, therefore, that the available data do not allow us to confirm existence and identify the true soft X-ray counterpart to the burst event. Presence of a soft counterpart is, however, essential to unambiguously associate the burst with a magnetar flare, and thus we conclude that magnetar origin of the burst and precise burst location remain uncertain and require further investigation.

[2101.10837] The Ikshana Hypothesis of Human Scene Understanding	Venkata Satya Sai Ajay DaliparthiBlekinge Insitute of TechnologyKarlskrona,		veda18@student.bth.se	In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) achieved state-of-the-art performance on several computer vision tasks. However, the one typical drawback of these DNNs is the requirement of massive labeled data. Even though few-shot learning methods address this problem, they often use techniques such as meta-learning and metric-learning on top of the existing methods. In this work, we address this problem from a neuroscience perspective by proposing a hypothesis named Ikshana, which is supported by several findings in neuroscience. Our hypothesis approximates the refining process of conceptual gist in the human brain while understanding a natural scene/image. While our hypothesis holds no particular novelty in neuroscience, it provides a novel perspective for designing DNNs for vision tasks. By following the Ikshana hypothesis, we design a novel neural-inspired CNN architecture named IkshanaNet. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by outperforming several baselines on the entire and subsets of the Cityscapes and the CamVid semantic segmentation benchmarks.

For this purpose, the Channel State Information that a VLC receiver computes to equalize the subcarriers of the OFDM signal can be also reused to train an Unsupervised Learning classifier. This way, different clusters can be created on the collected CSI data, which could be then mapped into relevant events to-be-monitored in the indoor environments, such as the presence of a new object in a given position or the change of the position of a given object. When compared to supervised learning algorithms, the proposed approach does not need to add tags in the training data, simplifying notably the implementation of the machine learning classifier. The practical validation the monitoring approach was done with the aid of a software-defined VLC link based on OFDM, in which a copy of the intensity modulated signal coming from a Phosphor-converted LED was captured by a pair of Photodetectors (PDs). The performance evaluation of the experimental VLC-based monitoring demo achieved a positioning accuracy in the few-centimeter-range, without the necessity of deploying a large number of sensors and/or adding a VLC-enabled sensor on the object to-be-tracked.

[2101.10842] Source-free Domain Adaptation via Distributional Alignment by Matching Batch Normalization Statistics	Masato Ishii Masashi Sugiyama			In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation method for the source-free setting. In this setting, we cannot access source data during adaptation, while unlabeled target data and a model pretrained with source data are given. Due to lack of source data, we cannot directly match the data distributions between domains unlike typical domain adaptation algorithms. To cope with this problem, we propose utilizing batch normalization statistics stored in the pretrained model to approximate the distribution of unobserved source data. Specifically, we fix the classifier part of the model during adaptation and only fine-tune the remaining feature encoder part so that batch normalization statistics of the features extracted by the encoder match those stored in the fixed classifier. Additionally, we also maximize the mutual information between the features and the classifier’s outputs to further boost the classification performance. Experimental results with several benchmark datasets show that our method achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods even though it does not require access to source data.

However, these nice properties disappear for dimer algebras on higher genus surfaces. We consider a new class of quiver algebras on surfaces, called ‘geodesic ghor algebras’, that reduce to cancellative dimer algebras on a torus, yet continue to have nice properties on higher genus surfaces. These algebras exhibit a rich interplay between their central geometry and the topology of the surface. We show that (nontrivial) geodesic ghor algebras do in fact exist, and give explicit descriptions of their central geometry. This article serves a companion to the article ‘A generalization of cancellative dimer aglebras to hyperbolic surfaces’, where the main statement is proven.

This task is non-trivial since it is hard to conduct pixel-level matching among different views. To address this issue, most existing methods seek to exploit the geometric information to match pixels. However, when the distinct cameras have a large baseline (i.e., far away from each other), severe geometry distortion issues would occur and the geometric information may fail to provide useful guidance, resulting in very blurry synthesized images. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel deep generative model, called Self-Consistent Generative Network (SCGN), which synthesizes novel views from the given input views without explicitly exploiting the geometric information. The proposed SCGN model consists of two main components,i.e., a View Synthesis Network (VSN) and a View Decomposition Network (VDN), both employing an Encoder-Decoder structure. Here, the VDN seeks to reconstruct input views from the synthesized novel view to preserve the consistency of view synthesis. Thanks to VDN, SCGN is able to synthesize novel views without using any geometric rectification before encoding, making it easier for both training and applications. Finally, adversarial loss is introduced to improve the photo-realism of novel views. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons against several state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark tasks demonstrated the superiority of our approach.

Alessandro Bria Claudio Marrocco Francesco Tortorella	institutetext:		Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) based on motor imagery translate mental motor images recognized from the electroencephalogram (EEG) to control commands. EEG patterns of different imagination tasks, e.g. hand and foot movements, are effectively classified with machine learning techniques using band power features. Recently, also Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that learn both effective features and classifiers simultaneously from raw EEG data have been applied. However, CNNs have two major drawbacks: (i) they have a very large number of parameters, which thus requires a very large number of training examples; and (ii) they are not designed to explicitly learn features in the frequency domain. To overcome these limitations, in this work we introduce Sinc-EEGNet, a lightweight CNN architecture that combines learnable band-pass and depthwise convolutional filters. Experimental results obtained on the publicly available BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a show that our approach outperforms reference methods in terms of classification accuracy.

We also make a phenomenological estimate for how chiral fluctuations could effect the momentum spectrum of soft pions.Method:We first formulate the appropriate stochastic hydrodynamic equations close to thecritical point. Then, working in mean field, we determine the correlation functions of the stress tensor and the currents which result from this stochastic real time theory, and use these correlation functions to determine the scaling behavior of the transport coefficients. The hydrodynamic theory also describes the propagation of pion waves, fixing the scaling behavior of the dispersion curve of soft pions.Results:We present scaling functions for the shear viscosity and the charge conductivities near the pseudo-critical point, and estimate the absolute magnitude of the critical fluctuations to these parameters and the bulk viscosity. Using the calculated pion dispersion curve, we estimate the expected critical enhancement of soft pion yields, and this estimate provides a plausible explanation for the excess seen in experiment relative to ordinary hydrodynamic computations.Conclusions:Our results motivate further phenomenological and numerical work on the implications of chiral symmetry on real time properties of thermal QCD near the pseudo-critical point.

This includes broad emission line systems and blazars whose optical spectra lack emission lines but dominated by the absorption features arising from the host galaxy. The averagefor the sample isand there are evidences suggesting the association of more massive black holes with absorption line systems. Our results indicate a bi-modality ofin Eddington units (/) with broad line objects tend to have a higher accretion rate (/0.01). We have found that/and Compton dominance (CD, the ratio of the inverse Compton to synchrotron peak luminosities) are positively correlated at5confidence level, suggesting that the latter can be used to reveal the state of accretion in blazars. Based on this result, we propose a CD based classification scheme. Sources with CD1 can be classified as High-Compton Dominated or HCD blazars, whereas, that with CD1 are Low-Compton Dominated (LCD) objects. This scheme is analogous to that based on the mass accretion rate proposed in the literature, however, it overcomes the limitation imposed by the difficulty in measuringandfor objects with quasi-featureless spectra. We conclude that the overall physical properties ofFermiblazars are likely to be controlled by the accretion rate in Eddington units.

The coupling of magnetic fields to the gas depends on its ionization degree. We calculate the temperature evolution and ionization degree of a cloud for various metallicities of, and. We update the chemical network by reversing all the gas-phase processes and by considering grain-surface chemistry, including grain evaporation, thermal ionization of alkali metals, and thermionic emission from grains. The ionization degree atbecomes up to eight orders of magnitude higher than that obtained in the previous model, owing to the thermionic emission and thermal ionization of K and Na, which have been neglected so far. Although magnetic fields dissipate owing to ambipolar diffusion or Ohmic loss at, the fields recover strong coupling to the gas at, which is lower by a few orders of magnitude compared to the previous work. We develop a reduced chemical network by choosing processes relevant to major coolants and charged species. The reduced network consists of 104 (161) reactions among 28 (38) species in the absence (presence, respectively) of ionization sources. The reduced model includes Hand HD formation on grain surfaces as well as the depletion of O, C, OH, CO, and HO on grain surfaces.	stars: formation | stars: Population III | stars: Population II

Bin Cao is with Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications China.	Lei.Zhang@glasgow.ac.uk	Blockchain is built on a peer-to-peer network that relies on frequent communications among the distributively located nodes. In particular, the consensus mechanisms (CMs), which play a pivotal role in blockchain, are communication resource-demanding and largely determines blockchain security bound and other key performance metrics such as transaction throughput, latency and scalability. Most blockchain systems are designed in a stable wired communication network running in advanced devices under the assumption of sufficient communication resource provision. However, it is envisioned that the majority of the blockchain node peers will be connected through the wireless network in the future. Constrained by the highly dynamic wireless channel and scarce frequency spectrum, communication can significantly affect blockchain’s key performance metrics. Hence, in this paper, we present wireless blockchain networks (WBN) under various commonly used CMs and we answer the question of how much communication resource is needed to run such a network. We first present the role of communication in the four stages of the blockchain procedure. We then discuss the relationship between the communication resource provision and the WBNs performance, for three of the most used blockchain CMs namely, Proof-of-Work (PoW), practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) and Raft. Finally, we provide analytical and simulated results to show the impact of the communication resource provision on blockchain performance.

Surveillance of fecal contamination is commonly performed by routine monitoring for a single type or a few types of microorganism(s). To design a feasible routine for periodic monitoring and to control risks of exposure to pathogens, reliable statistical algorithms for inferring correlations between concentrations of microorganisms in water need to be established. Moreover, because pathogens are often present in low concentrations, some contaminations are likely to be under a detection limit. This yields a pairwise left-censored dataset and complicates computation of correlation coefficients. Errors of correlation estimation can be smaller if undetected values are imputed better. To obtain better imputations, we utilize side information and develop a new technique, theasymmetric Tobit modelwhich is an extension of the Tobit model so that domain knowledge can be exploited effectively when fitting the model to a censored dataset. The empirical results demonstrate that imputation with domain knowledge is effective for this task.

Based on this relation, it is possible to come up with mathematically equivalent but two different interpretations. From one point of view while the universe is static, the masses of the elementary particles change with time. The other one, which we stick with throughout the manuscript, is that while the universe is expanding, particle masses are constant. Thus, a coupled Lagrangian density of the JBD field and the scale factor (the Higgs field), which exhibit a massive particle and a linearly expanding space in zeroth order respectively, is obtained. By performing a coordinate transformation in the field space for the reduced JBD action whose kinetic part is nonlinear sigma model, the Lagrangian of two scalar fields can be written as uncoupled for the Higgs mechanism. After this transformation, as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the time dependent vacuum expectation value (vev) of the Higgs field and the Higgs bosons which are the particles corresponding to quantized oscillation modes about the vacuum, are found.

In this paper, Blockchain-enabled Radio Access Networks (BE-RAN) is proposed as a novel decentralized RAN architecture to facilitate enhanced security and privacy on identification and authentication. It can offer user-centric identity management for User Equipment (UE) and RAN elements, and enable mutual authentication to all entities while enabling on-demand point-to-point communication with accountable billing service add-on on public network. Also, a potential operating model with thorough decentralization of RAN is envisioned. The paper also proposed a distributed privacy-preserving P2P communication approach, as one of the core use cases for future mobile networks, is presented as an essential complement to the existing core network-based security and privacy management. The results show that BE-RAN significantly improves communication and computation overheads compared to the existing communication authentication protocols.

In the remote sensing field, surveys and literature revisions specifically involving DNNs algorithms’ applications have been conducted in an attempt to summarize the amount of information produced in its subfields. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) based applications have dominated aerial sensing research. However, a literature revision that combines both “deep learning” and “UAV remote sensing” thematics has not yet been conducted. The motivation for our work was to present a comprehensive review of the fundamentals of Deep Learning (DL) applied in UAV-based imagery. We focused mainly on describing classification and regression techniques used in recent applications with UAV-acquired data. For that, a total of 232 papers published in international scientific journal databases was examined. We gathered the published material and evaluated their characteristics regarding application, sensor, and technique used. We relate how DL presents promising results and has the potential for processing tasks associated with UAV-based image data. Lastly, we project future perspectives, commentating on prominent DL paths to be explored in the UAV remote sensing field. Our revision consists of a friendly-approach to introduce, commentate, and summarize the state-of-the-art in UAV-based image applications with DNNs algorithms in diverse subfields of remote sensing, grouping it in the environmental, urban, and agricultural contexts.

Silva333Partially supported by CNPq and FAPESP.Department of Computer Sciences and Statistics,Universidade Estadual Paulista, 15054-000 S.J. Rio Preto, Brazil			In this paper we consider nonautonomous optimal control problems of infinite horizon type, whose control actions are given by-functions. We verify that the value function is locally Lipschitz. The equivalence between dynamic programming inequalities and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) inequalities for proximal sub (super) gradients is proven. Using this result we show that the value function is a Dini solution of the HJB equation. We obtain a verification result for the class of Dini sub-solutions of the HJB equation and also prove a minimax property of the value function with respect to the sets of Dini semi-solutions of the HJB equation. We introduce the concept of viscosity solutions of the HJB equation in infinite horizon and prove the equivalence between this and the concept of Dini solutions. In the appendix we provide an existence theorem.	
[2101.10864] Bulk topological states in a new collective dynamics model	PierreDegond AntoineDiez MingyeNa	Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse; UMR5219; Université de Toulouse; CNRS; UPS; F-31062 Toulouse Cedex 9 	12121231@mail.sustech.edu.cn pierre.degond@math.univ-toulouse.fr	In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of topological states in a new collective dynamics model. This individual-based model (IBM) describes self-propelled rigid bodies moving with constant speed and adjusting their rigid-body attitude to that of their neighbors. In previous works, a macroscopic model has been derived from this IBM in a suitable scaling limit. In the present work, we exhibit explicit solutions of the macroscopic model characterized by a non-trivial topology. We show that these solutions are well approximated by the IBM during a certain time but then the IBM transitions towards topologically trivial states. Using a set of appropriately defined topological indicators, we reveal that the breakage of the non-trivial topology requires the system to go through a phase of maximal disorder. We also show that similar but topologically trivial initial conditions result in markedly different dynamics, suggesting that topology plays a key role in the dynamics of this system.

Householder Nathan VanHoudnos	jspring AT sei dot cmu dot edu0000-0001-9356-219XCERT® Coordination CenterSoftware Engineering InstituteCarnegie Mellon UniversityPittsburghPA15213		This paper explores how the current paradigm of vulnerability management might adapt to include machine learning systems through a thought experiment: what if flaws inmachine learning(ML) were assignedidentifiers? We consider bothMLalgorithms and model objects. The hypothetical scenario is structured around exploring the changes to the six areas of vulnerability management: discovery, report intake, analysis, coordination, disclosure, and response. While algorithm flaws are well-known in the academic research community, there is no apparent clear line of communication between this research community and the operational communities that deploy and manage systems that useML. The thought experiments identify some ways in whichCVE-IDsmay establish some useful lines of communication between these two communities. In particular, it would start to introduce the research community to operational security concepts, which appears to be a gap left by existing efforts.	vulnerability management | machine learning | CVE-ID | prioritization
[2101.10866] Deep neural network-based automatic metasurface design with a wide frequency range	Fardin Ghorbani Sina Beyraghi Javad Shabanpour Homayoon Oraizi Hossein Soleimani Mohammad Soleimani		fardin.ghorbania@gmail.com m.javadshabanpour1372@gmail.com	Beyond the scope of conventional metasurface which necessitates plenty of computational resources and time, an inverse design approach using machine learning algorithms promises an effective way for metasurfaces design. In this paper, benefiting from Deep Neural Network (DNN), an inverse design procedure of a metasurface in an ultra-wide working frequency band is presented where the output unit cell structure can be directly computed by a specified design target. To reach the highest working frequency, for training the DNN, we consider 8 ring-shaped patterns to generate resonant notches at a wide range of working frequencies from 4 to 45 GHz. We propose two network architectures. In one architecture, we restricted the output of the DNN, so the network can only generate the metasurface structure from the input of 8 ring-shaped patterns. This approach drastically reduces the computational time, while keeping the network’s accuracy above 91%. We show that our model based on DNN can satisfactorily generate the output metasurface structure with an average accuracy of over 90% in both network architectures. Determination of the metasurface structure directly without time-consuming optimization procedures, having ultra-wide working frequency, and high average accuracy equip an inspiring platform for engineering projects without the need for complex electromagnetic theory.

[2101.10867] On the robustness of certain norms	William Leeb	School of Mathematics University of Minnesota Twin Cities. Minneapolis MN.		We study a family of norms defined for functions on an interval. These norms are obtained by taking the-norm of the Volterra operator applied to the function. The corresponding distances have been previously studied in the context of comparing probability measures, and special cases include the Earth Mover’s Distance and Kolmogorov Metric. We study their properties for general signals, and show that they are robust to additive noise. We also show that the norm-induced distance between a function and its perturbation is bounded by the size of the perturbation, and that the distance between one-dimensional projections of a two-dimensional function is bounded by the size of the difference in projection directions. The results are illustrated in numerical experiments.	
[2101.10868] An In-depth Review of Privacy Concerns Raised by the COVID-19 Pandemic	Jiaqi Wang			COVID-19 has hugely changed our lives, work, and interactions with people. With more and more online activities, people are easily exposed to privacy threats. In this paper, we explore how users self-disclose on social media and privacy concerns raised from these behaviors. Based on recent news, techniques, and research, we indicate three increasing privacy threats caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. After that, we provide a systematic analysis of potential privacy issues related to the COVID pandemic. Furthermore, we propose a series of research directions about online user self-disclosure and privacy issues for future work as well as possible solutions.

However, the analysis of the effectiveness and the efficiency of HAR methodologies suffers from the lack of a standard workflow, which might represent the baseline for the estimation of the quality of the developed pattern recognition models. This makes the comparison among different approaches a challenging task. In addition, researchers can make mistakes that, when not detected, definitely affect the achieved results. To mitigate such issues, this paper proposes an open-source automatic and highly configurable framework, named B-HAR, for the definition, standardization, and development of a baseline framework in order to evaluate and compare HAR methodologies. It implements the most popular data processing methods for data preparation and the most commonly used machine and deep learning pattern recognition models.

[2101.10871] Chromospheric Activity in 55 Cancri: I. Results from Theoretical Wave Studies	Diaa E. Fawzyand Manfred CuntzFaculty of Engineering, Izmir University of Economics, 35330 Izmir, TurkeyDepartment of Physics, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, USA	E-mail: (MC)	cuntz@uta.edu	We present theoretical models of chromospheric heating for 55 Cancri, an orange dwarf of relatively low activity. Self-consistent, nonlinear and time-dependentab-initionumerical computations are pursued encompassing the generation, propagation, and dissipation of waves. We consider longitudinal waves operating among arrays of flux tubes as well as acoustic waves pertaining to nonmagnetic stellar regions. Additionally, flux enhancements for the longitudinal waves are also taken into account as supplied by transverse tube waves. The Ca II K fluxes are computed (multi-ray treatment) assuming partial redistribution as well as time-dependent ionization. The self-consistent treatment of time-dependent ionization (especially for hydrogen) greatly impacts the atmospheric temperatures and electron densities (especially behind the shocks); it also affects the emergent Ca II fluxes. Particularly, we focus on the influence of magnetic heating on the stellar atmospheric structure and the emergent Ca II emission, as well as the impact of nonlinearities. Our study shows that a higher photospheric magnetic filling factor entails a larger Ca II emission; however, an increased initial wave energy flux (e.g., associated with mode coupling) is of little difference. Comparisons of our theoretical results with observations will be conveyed in forthcoming Paper II.	methods: numerical – stars: chromospheres – stars: magnetic fields – stars: individual (55 Cnc) – magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)

We present viscous relativistic hydrodynamic calculations of ultra-central p+A collisions and develop an experimental observable to probe the structure, correlating the polarization and momentum of hyperons emitted from the collision. This effect is robust against changes in the definition of vorticity used to calculate the polarization. Experiments at RHIC and LHC may test the existence and strength of the vortex toroids, bringing new evidence to bear on the question of collectivity in the smallest QGP droplets.	pacs:25.75.Ld | 25.75.Gz | 05.70.Fh

Physics however aims to explain, rather than describe, experiments through theories. While most theories of physics are based on real numbers, quantum theory was the first to be formulated in terms of operators acting on complex Hilbert spaces[1,2]. This has puzzled countless physicists, including the fathers of the theory, for whom a real version of quantum theory, in terms of real operators, seemed much more natural[3]. In fact, previous works showed that such ‘real quantum theory’ can reproduce the outcomes of any multipartite experiment, as long as the parts share arbitrary real quantum states[4]. Thus, are complex numbers really needed in the quantum formalism? Here, we show this to be case by proving that real and complex quantum theory make different predictions in network scenarios comprising independent states and measurements. This allows us to devise a Bell-like experiment whose successful realization would disprove real quantum theory, in the same way as standard Bell experiments disproved local physics.

To this end, LG can offer a unique site to tackle questions about the formation and evolution of galaxies by providing detailed information. While large telescopes are often the first choices for such studies, small telescope surveys that perform dedicated observations are still important, particularly in studying bright objects in the nearby universe. In this regard, we conducted a nine epoch survey of 55 dwarf galaxies called the “Local Group dwarf galaxies survey” using the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) in the La Palma to identify Long-Period Variable (LPV) stars, namely Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and Red Super Giant (RSG) stars. AGB stars formed at different times and studying their radial distribution and mass-loss rate can shed light on the structure formation in galaxies. To further investigate the evolutionary path of these galaxies, we construct their star formation history (SFH) using the LPV stars, which are at the final stages of their evolution and therefore experience brightness fluctuations on the timescales between hundred to thousand days. In this paper, we present some of the results of the Local Group dwarf galaxies survey.

Besides having a large impact on the star formation history, mergers are also able to influence gas motions at the centre of galaxies and trigger an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). In this paper, we present a case study of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 2992, which together with NGC 2993 forms the early-stage merger system Arp 245. Using Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) integral field unit (IFU) data from the inner 1.1 kpc of the galaxy we were able to spatially resolve the stellar populations, the ionisation mechanism and kinematics of ionised gas. From full spectral synthesis, we found that the stellar population is primarily composed by old metal-rich stars (t1.4 Gyr,), with a contribution of at most 30 per cent of the light from a young and metal-poor population (t100 Myr,). We detect Hand Hemission from the Broad Line Region (BLR) with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of2000. The Narrow Line Region (NLR) kinematics presents two main components: one from gas orbiting the galaxy disk and a blueshifted (velocity-200) outflow, possibly correlated with the radio emission, with mass outflow rate of2 Myrand a kinematic power of2erg s(/0.2 per cent). We also show even though the main ionisation mechanism is the AGN radiation, ionisation by young stars and shocks may also contribute to the emission line ratios presented in the innermost region of the galaxy.

In particular, we show how neural networks can be trained to perform all of these tasks simultaneously. While, deep autoencoders implemented by way of neural networks have demonstrated potential for denoising and anomaly detection, standard autoencoders have the drawback that they require access to clean data for training. However, recent work in Robust Deep Autoencoders (RDAEs) shows how autoencoders can be trained to eliminate outliers and noise in a dataset without access to any clean training data. Inspired by this work, we extend RDAEs to the case where data are not only noisy and have outliers, but also only partially observed. Moreover, the dataset we train the neural network on has the properties that all entries have noise, some entries are corrupted by large mistakes, and many entries are not even known. Given such an algorithm, many standard tasks, such as denoising, image inpainting, and unobserved entry imputation can all be accomplished simultaneously within the same framework. Herein we demonstrate these techniques on standard machine learning tasks, such as image inpainting and denoising for the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. However, these approaches are not only applicable to image processing problems, but also have wide ranging impacts on datasets arising from real-world problems, such as manufacturing and network processing, where noisy, partially observed data naturally arise.

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been suggested as a tool to overcome such bottlenecks. Following this suggestion, we investigated the effectiveness for EL documentation of end-to-end ASR, which unlike Hidden Markov Model ASR systems, eschews linguistic resources but is instead more dependent on large-data settings. We open source a Yoloxóchitl Mixtec EL corpus. First, we review our method in building an end-to-end ASR system in a way that would be reproducible by the ASR community. We then propose a novice transcription correction task and demonstrate how ASR systems and novice transcribers can work together to improve EL documentation. We believe this combinatory methodology would mitigate the transcription bottleneck and transcriber shortage that hinders EL documentation.	
[2101.10878] Blue extreme disk-runaway stars with Gaia EDR3	Andreas Irrgang Markus Dimpel Ulrich Heber Roberto Raddi	institutetext:	andreas.irrgang@fau.de	Since the discovery of hypervelocity stars in 2005, it has been widely believed that only the disruption of a binary system by a supermassive black hole at the Galactic center (GC), that is, the so-called Hills mechanism, is capable of accelerating stars to beyond the Galactic escape velocity. In the meantime, however, driven by theGaiaspace mission, there is mounting evidence that many of the most extreme high-velocity early-type stars at high Galactic latitudes do originate in the Galactic disk and not in the GC. Moreover, the ejection velocities of these extreme disk-runaway stars exceed the predicted limits of the classical scenarios for the production of runaway stars. Based on proper motions from theGaiaearly data release 3 and on recent and new spectrophotometric distances, we studied the kinematics of 30 such extreme disk-runaway stars, allowing us to deduce their spatial origins in and their ejection velocities from the Galactic disk with unprecedented precision. Only three stars in the sample have past trajectories that are consistent with an origin in the GC, most notably S5-HVS 1, which is the most extreme object in the sample by far. All other program stars are shown to be disk runaways with ejection velocities that sharply contrast at least with classical ejection scenarios. They include HVS 5 and HVS 6, which are both gravitationally unbound to the Milky Way. While most stars originate from within a galactocentric radius of 15 kpc, which corresponds to the observed extent of the spiral arms, a group of five stars stems from radii of about 21–29 kpc. This indicates a possible link to outer Galactic rings and a potential origin from infalling satellite galaxies.

[2101.10880] USP: an independence test that improves on Pearson’s chi-squared and the 𝐺-test	Thomas B. Berrettand Richard J. SamworthUniversity of Warwick andUniversity of		tom.berrett@warwick.ac.uk r.samworth@statslab.cam.ac.uk	We present the-Statistic Permutation (USP) test of independence in the context of discrete data displayed in a contingency table. Either Pearson’s chi-squared test of independence, or the-test, are typically used for this task, but we argue that these tests have serious deficiencies, both in terms of their inability to control the size of the test, and their power properties. By contrast, the USP test is guaranteed to control the size of the test at the nominal level for all sample sizes, has no issues with small (or zero) cell counts, and is able to detect distributions that violate independence in only a minimal way. The test statistic is derived from a-statistic estimator of a natural population measure of dependence, and we prove that this is the unique minimum variance unbiased estimator of this population quantity. The practical utility of the USP test is demonstrated on both simulated data, where its power can be dramatically greater than those of Pearson’s test and the-test, and on real data. The USP test is implemented in theRpackageUSP.

Jan Verschelde	thanks:	janv@uic.edu	The problem is to evaluate a polynomial in several variables and its gradient at a power series truncated to some finite degree with multiple double precision arithmetic. To compensate for the cost overhead of multiple double precision and power series arithmetic, data parallel algorithms for general purpose graphics processing units are presented. The reverse mode of algorithmic differentiation is organized into a massively parallel computation of many convolutions and additions of truncated power series. Experimental results demonstrate that teraflop performance is obtained in deca double precision with power series truncated at degree 152. The algorithms scale well for increasing precision and increasing degrees.	Keywords.

In particular, we solve an open question posed by Revuz and Yor[12]. Motivated by the application to maximal inequalities, like e.g. the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality, we also study the domination inequality under an additional monotonicity assumption. In this special case, a constant which stays bounded fornearwas proven by Pratelli and Lenglart. We provide the sharp constant for this case.

The effects of PCD species, nonthermal electron species, and adiabatic ion-temperature on ion-acoustic (IA) solitary waves (SWs) and double layers (DLs) are investigated by the pseudo-potential approach, which is valid for the arbitrary amplitude time-independent SWs and DLs. It is observed that the presence of the PCD species reduces the phase speed of the IA waves, and consequently supports the IA subsonic compressive SWs in such electron-ion-PCD plasmas. On the other hand, the increase in both adiabatic ion-temperature and the number of nonthermal or fast electrons causes to reduce the possibility for the formation of the subsonic SWs, and thus convert subsonic SWs into supersonic ones. It is also observed that after at a certain value of the nonthermal parameter, the IA supersonic SWs with both positive and negative potentials as well as the DLs with only negative potential exist. The applications of the work in space environments (viz. Earth’s mesosphere, cometary tails, Jupiter’s magnetosphere, etc.) and laboratory devices, where the warm ion and nonthermal electron species along with PCD species have been observed, are briefly discussed.

DeSimone		desimone@sissa.it davide.riccobelli@polimi.it giovanni.noselli@sissa.it	Mechanical instabilities can be exploited to design innovative structures, able to change their shape in the presence of external stimuli. In this work, we derive a mathematical model of an elastic beam subjected to an axial force and constrained to smoothly slide along a rigid support, where the distance between the rod midline and the constraint is fixed and finite. Using both theoretical and computational techniques, we characterize the bifurcations of such a mechanical system, in which the axial force and the natural curvature of the beam are used as control parameters. We show that, in the presence of a straight support, the rod can deform into shapes exhibiting helices and perversions, namely transition zones connecting together two helices with opposite chirality. The mathematical predictions of the proposed model are also compared with some experiments, showing a good quantitative agreement. In particular, we find that the buckled configurations may exhibit multiple perversions and we propose a possible explanation for this phenomenon based on the energy landscape of the mechanical system.

[2101.10891] Regularizing (away) vacuum energy	Adam Koberinski111Department of Philosophy, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1,		atkoberi@uwaterloo.ca	In this paper I formulate Minimal Requirements for Candidate Predictions in quantum field theories, inspired by viewing the standard model as an effective field theory. I then survey standard effective field theory regularization procedures, to see if the vacuum expectation value of energy density () is a quantity that meets these requirements. The verdict is negative, leading to the conclusion thatis not a physically significant quantity in the standard model. Rigorous extensions of flat space quantum field theory eliminatefrom their conceptual framework, indicating that it lacks physical significance in the framework of quantum field theory more broadly. This result has consequences for problems in cosmology and quantum gravity, as it suggests that the correct solution to the cosmological constant problem involves a revision of the vacuum concept within quantum field theory.

Learning the parameters of a kinematic model can be achieved by observing the position of the robot links during prospective motions and minimising the prediction errors. This work proposes a movement efficient approach for estimating online the body-schema of a humanoid robot arm in the form of Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters. A cost-sensitive active learning approach based on the A-Optimality criterion is used to select optimal joint configurations. The chosen joint configurations simultaneously minimise the error in the estimation of the body schema and minimise the movement between samples. This reduces energy consumption, along with mechanical fatigue and wear, while not compromising the learning accuracy. The work was implemented in a simulation environment, using the 7DoF arm of the iCub robot simulator. The hand pose is measured with a single camera via markers placed in the palm and back of the robot’s hand. A non-parametric occlusion model is proposed to avoid choosing joint configurations where the markers are not visible, thus preventing worthless attempts. The results show cost-sensitive active learning has similar accuracy to the standard active learning approach, while reducing in about half the executed movement.	cost-sensitive active learning | body-schema | calibration | humanoid | robotics
[2101.10893] Dynamic cyber risk estimation with Competitive Quantile Autoregression	Raisa Dzhamtyrova Carsten Maple	The Alan Turing Institute		The increasing value of data held in enterprises makes it an attractive target to attackers. The increasing likelihood and impact of a cyber attack have highlighted the importance of effective cyber risk estimation. We propose two methods for modelling Value-at-Risk (VaR) which can be used for any time-series data. The first approach is based on Quantile Autoregression (QAR), which can estimate VaR for different quantiles, i. e. confidence levels. The second method, we term Competitive Quantile Autoregression (CQAR), dynamically re-estimates cyber risk as soon as new data becomes available. This method provides a theoretical guarantee that it asymptotically performs as well as any QAR at any time point in the future. We show that these methods can predict the size and inter-arrival time of cyber hacking breaches by running coverage tests. The proposed approaches allow to model a separate stochastic process for each significance level and therefore provide more flexibility compared to previously proposed techniques. We provide a fully reproducible code used for conducting the experiments.

In this article, we explore data clustering to examine and understand how actual death claims differ from expected, an early stage of developing a monitoring system crucial for risk management. We extend the-prototypes clustering algorithm to draw inference from a life insurance dataset using only the insured’s characteristics and policy information without regard to known mortality. This clustering has the feature to efficiently handle categorical, numerical, and spatial attributes. Using gap statistics, the optimal clusters obtained from the algorithm are then used to compare actual to expected death claims experience of the life insurance portfolio. Our empirical data contains observations, during 2014, of approximately 1.14 million policies with a total insured amount of over 650 billion dollars. For this portfolio, the algorithm produced three natural clusters, with each cluster having a lower actual to expected death claims but with differing variability. The analytical results provide management a process to identify policyholders’ attributes that dominate significant mortality deviations, and thereby enhance decision making for taking necessary actions.	
[2101.10897] HexCNN: A Framework for Native Hexagonal Convolutional Neural Networks	Yunxiang Zhao2, Qiuhong Ke2, Flip Korn3, Jianzhong Qi2, Rui Zhang 21	1Rui Zhang is the corresponding author2The University of Melbourne Australia 3Google Research rui.zhang@ }unimelb.edu.au 	flip@google.com	Hexagonal CNN models have shown superior performance in applications such as IACT data analysis and aerial scene classification due to their better rotation symmetry and reduced anisotropy. In order to realize hexagonal processing, existing studies mainly use the ZeroOut method to imitate hexagonal processing, which causes substantial memory and computation overheads. We address this deficiency with a novel native hexagonal CNN framework namedHexCNN. HexCNN takes hexagon-shaped input and performs forward and backward propagation on the original form of the input based on hexagon-shaped filters, hence avoiding computation and memory overheads caused by imitation. For applications with rectangle-shaped input but require hexagonal processing, HexCNN can be applied by padding the input into hexagon-shape as preprocessing. In this case, we show that the time and space efficiency of HexCNN still outperforms existing hexagonal CNN methods substantially. Experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art models, which imitate hexagonal processing but using rectangle-shaped filters, HexCNN reduces the training time by up to 42.2%. Meanwhile, HexCNN saves the memory space cost by up to 25% and 41.7% for loading the input and performing convolution, respectively.

However, several challenges must first be addressed to realize these benefits, as the resource management, network control, network security, spectrum management, and energy usage of satellite networks are more challenging than that of terrestrial networks. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, has been steadily growing as a research field and has shown successful results in diverse applications, including wireless communication. In particular, the application of AI to a wide variety of satellite communication aspects have demonstrated excellent potential, including beam-hopping, anti-jamming, network traffic forecasting, channel modeling, telemetry mining, ionospheric scintillation detecting, interference managing, remote sensing, behavior modeling, space-air-ground integrating, and energy managing. This work thus provides a general overview of AI, its diverse sub-fields, and its state-of-the-art algorithms. Several challenges facing diverse aspects of satellite communication systems are then discussed, and their proposed and potential AI-based solutions are presented. Finally, an outlook of field is drawn, and future steps are suggested.	Satellite Communication | Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning | Deep Learning | Reinforcement Learning

Despite its advantages, there is an increased potential for cyberattacks on FL-based ML techniques that can undermine the benefits. Model-poisoning attacks on FL target the availability of the model. The adversarial objective is to disrupt the training. We propose attestedFL, a defense mechanism that monitors the training of individual nodes through state persistence in order to detect a maliciousworker. A fine-grained assessment of the history of theworkerpermits the evaluation of its behavior in time and results in innovative detection strategies. We present three lines of defense that aim at assessing if theworkeris reliable by observing if the node is truly training, while advancing towards a goal. Our defense exposes an attacker’s malicious behavior and removes unreliable nodes from the aggregation process so that the FL process converge faster. attestedFL increased the accuracy of the model in different FL settings, under different attacking patterns, and scenarios e.g., attacks performed at different stages of the convergence, colluding attackers, and continuous attacks.	poison attack | federated learning | behaviour | detection | attestation

Given a set of pointsand a radius parameter, the-near neighbor (-NN) problem asks for a data structure that, given any query point, returns a pointwithin distance at mostfrom. In this paper, we study the-NN problem in the light of individual fairness and providing equal opportunities: all points that are within distancefrom the query should have the same probability to be returned. In the low-dimensional case, this problem was first studied by Hu, Qiao, and Tao (PODS 2014). Locality sensitive hashing (LSH), the theoretically strongest approach to similarity search in high dimensions, does not provide such a fairness guarantee.

This implies that vacuum anti-de Sitter space plays the role of the reference state. Moreover, the complexity of an anti-de Sitter-Schwarzschild black hole becomes intrinsically finite and saturates Lloyd’s bound after a critical time. It is also argued that several artifacts, such as the unphysical negative-time interval, can be removed by truly considering the bulk dual of the thermofield double state.

The conjectures for the rank of a partition were proved by Andrews by using results due to Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer on a suitable generating function, while the conjectures related to cranks were studied by Shane Chern using weighted partition moments. We revisit the conjectures on the crank of a partition by decomposing the relevant generating function and further explore connections with Apple-Lerch series and tenth order mock theta functions.

However, these compounds are known to loose their half-metallicity in the ultrathin film regime, as it is difficult to achieve L2ordering, which has become a bottleneck for the film growth. Here, the successful deposition using room temperature DC sputtering of the L2and B2 ordered phases of the CoFeAl full Heusler compound is reported. CoFeAl is used as ferromagnetic layer together with highly orientated Pt as non-ferromagnetic layer in the CoFeAl/Pt STE, where an MgO(10 nm) seed layer plays an important role to achieve the L2and B2 ordering of CoFeAl. The generation of THz radiation in the CFA/Pt STE is presented, which has a bandwidth in the range of 0.1-4 THz. The THz electric field amplitude is optimized with respect to thickness, orientation, and growth parameters using a thickness dependent model considering the optically induced spin current, superdiffusive spin current, inverse spin Hall effect and the attenuation of THz radiation in the layers. This study, based on the full Heusler CoFeAl compound opens up a plethora possibilities in STE research involving full Heusler compounds.

[2101.10913] Nondiscriminatory Treatment: a straightforward framework for multi-human parsing	Min Yan Guoshan Zhang Tong Zhang Yuemin Zhang		zhanggs@tju.edu.cn	Multi-human parsing aims to segment every body part of every human instance. Nearly all state-of-the-art methods follow the “detection first” or “segmentation first” pipelines. Different from them, we present an end-to-end and box-free pipeline from a new and more human-intuitive perspective. In training time, we directly do instance segmentation on humans and parts. More specifically, we introduce a notion of “indiscriminate objects with categories” which treats humans and parts without distinction and regards them both as instances with categories. In the mask prediction, each binary mask is obtained by a combination of prototypes shared among all human and part categories. In inference time, we design a brand-new grouping post-processing method that relates each part instance with one single human instance and groups them together to obtain the final human-level parsing result. We name our method as Nondiscriminatory Treatment between Humans and Parts for Human Parsing (NTHP). Experiments show that our network performs superiorly against state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on the MHP v2.0 and PASCAL-Person-Part datasets.

In this paper we investigate what makes disagreement constructive. To this end, we construct WikiDisputes, a corpus of 7 425 Wikipedia Talk page conversations that contain content disputes, and define the task of predicting whether disagreements will be escalated to mediation by a moderator. We evaluate feature-based models with linguistic markers from previous work, and demonstrate that their performance is improved by using features that capture changes in linguistic markers throughout the conversations, as opposed to averaged values. We develop a variety of neural models and show that taking into account the structure of the conversation improves predictive accuracy, exceeding that of feature-based models. We assess our best neural model in terms of both predictive accuracy and uncertainty by evaluating its behaviour when it is only exposed to the beginning of the conversation, finding that model accuracy improves and uncertainty reduces as models are exposed to more information.

To search this vast data trove for transit signals, we aim to provide an approach that both is computationally efficient and produces highly performant predictions. This approach minimizes the required human search effort. We present a convolutional neural network, which we train to identify planetary transit signals and dismiss false positives. To make a prediction for a given light curve, our network requires no prior transit parameters identified using other methods. Our network performs inference on aTESS30-minute cadence light curve in~5ms on a single GPU, enabling large scale archival searches. We present 181 new planet candidates identified by our network, which pass subsequent human vetting designed to rule out false positives. Our neural network model is additionally provided as open-source code for public use and extension.

By using the PMC single-scale approach, we obtain an accurate renormalization scale-and-scheme independent fixed-order pQCD contribution for GLS sum rule, e.g., where the error is squared average of those from, the predicted-order terms predicted by using the Padé approximation approach. After applying the PMC, a more convergent pQCD series has been obtained, and the contributions from the unknown higher-order terms are highly suppressed. In combination with the nonperturbative high-twist contribution, our final prediction of GLS sum rule agrees well with the experimental data given by the CCFR collaboration.

Moreover, we find that the all-genera invariants themselves coincide with the coefficients of the unique calibration of the Frobenius manifold of-type evaluated at a special point. For the(5-spin) case we also find two other normalizations of the sequence that are again integral and of at most exponential growth, and hence conjecturally are the Taylor coefficients of some period functions.

However, much of such work focused almost exclusively on English — a language with rigid word order and a lack of inflectional morphology. In this study, we present decoding experiments for multilingual BERT across 18 languages in order to test the generalizability of the claim that dependency syntax is reflected in attention patterns. We show that full trees can be decoded above baseline accuracy from single attention heads, and that individual relations are often tracked by the same heads across languages. Furthermore, in an attempt to address recent debates about the status of attention as an explanatory mechanism, we experiment with fine-tuning mBERT on a supervised parsing objective while freezing different series of parameters. Interestingly, in steering the objective to learn explicit linguistic structure, we find much of the same structure represented in the resulting attention patterns, with interesting differences with respect to which parameters are frozen.

Analytical kink solutions are derived from a concise superpotential formalism of the dynamical equations. A general analysis on the linear stability is conducted for an arbitrary static solution of the model. After gauge fixing, a Schrödinger-like equation with factorizable Hamiltonian operator is obtained, which ensures the linear stability of the solution.	2D Gravity; Solitons Monopoles and Instantons

[2101.10931] The collapse of a quantum state as a joint probability construction	Peter Morgan	Physics Department Yale University New Haven CT 06520 	peter.w.morgan@yale.edu	The collapse of a quantum state can be understood as a mathematical way to construct a joint probability densityeven for operators that do not commute. We can formalize that construction as a non-commutative, non-associativecollapse productthat is nonlinear in its left operand as a model for joint measurements at time-like separation, in part inspired by thesequential productfor positive semi-definite operators. The familiar collapsepicture, in which a quantum state collapses after each measurement as a way to construct a joint probability density for consecutive measurements, is equivalent to a no-collapse picture in which Lüders transformers applied to subsequent measurements construct a Quantum-Mechanics–Free-Subsystem of Quantum Non-Demolition operators, not as a dynamical process but as an alternative mathematical model for the same consecutive measurements. The no-collapse picture is particularly simpler when we apply signal analysis to millions or billions of consecutive measurements.	Keywords

Korreck D. Larson E. Lichko R. Livi M. McManus M. Martinović A. Rahmati M. Stevens P. Whittlesey	University of Arizona Tucson AZ USA		The hot and diffuse nature of the Sun’s extended atmosphere allows it to persist in non-equilibrium states for long enough that wave-particle instabilities can arise and modify the evolution of the expanding solar wind. Determining which instabilities arise, and how significant a role they play in governing the dynamics of the solar wind, has been a decades-long process involving in situ observations at a variety of radial distances. With new measurements from Parker Solar Probe (PSP), we can study what wave modes are driven near the Sun, and calculate what instabilities are predicted for different models of the underlying particle populations. We model two hours-long intervals of PSP/SPAN-i measurements of the proton phase-space density during PSP’s fourth perihelion with the Sun using two commonly used descriptions for the underlying velocity distribution. The linear stability and growth rates associated with the two models are calculated and compared. We find that both selected intervals are susceptible to resonant instabilities, though the growth rates and kind of modes driven unstable vary depending on if the protons are modeled using one or two components. In some cases, the predicted growth rates are large enough to compete with other dynamic processes, such as the nonlinear turbulent transfer of energy, in contrast with relatively slower instabilities at larger radial distances from the Sun.	solar wind — plasmas — instabilities — Sun: corona

Clint Harris222Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 330 N Orchard Street, Madison, WI 53715 USA; email:		clint.harris@wisc.edu	I describe a method for estimating agents’ perceived returns to investments that relies on cross-sectional data containing binary choices and prices, where prices may be imperfectly known to agents. This method identifies the scale of perceived returns by assuming agent knowledge of an identity that relates profits, revenues, and costs rather than by eliciting or assuming agent beliefs about structural parameters that are estimated by researchers. With this assumption, modest adjustments to standard binary choice estimators enable consistent estimation of perceived returns when using price instruments that are uncorrelated with unobserved determinants of agents’ price misperceptions as well as other unobserved determinants of their perceived returns. I demonstrate the method, and the importance of using price variation that is known to agents, in a series of data simulations.

Mentink	Radboud University Institute for Molecules and Materials (IMM) Heyendaalseweg 135 6525 AJ Nijmegen The NetherlandsRadboud University Institute for Molecules and Materials (IMM) Heyendaalseweg 135 6525 AJ Nijmegen The Netherlands		We investigate the propagation of magnons after ultrashort perturbations of the exchange interaction in the prototype two-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Using the recently proposed neural quantum states, we predict highly anisotropic spreading in space constrained by the symmetry of the perturbation. Interestingly, the propagation speed at the shortest length and time scale is up to 40% higher than the highest magnon velocity. We argue that the enhancement stems from extraordinary strong magnon-magnon interactions, suggesting new avenues for manipulating information transfer on ultrashort length and time scales.

Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden. e-mail:		hampus.engsner@math.su.se	In this paper we explore ways of numerically computing recursive dynamic monetary risk measures and utility functions. Computationally, this problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality and nested simulations are unfeasible if there are more than two time steps. The approach considered in this paper is to use a Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) algorithm to tackle this problem, a method which has been primarily considered for valuing American derivatives, or more general stopping time problems, as these also give rise to backward recursions with corresponding challenges in terms of numerical computation. We give some overarching consistency results for the LSM algorithm in a general setting as well as explore numerically its performance for recursive Cost-of-Capital valuation, a special case of a dynamic monetary utility function.

The result shows the asymptotic convergence of these classifiers under infinite amount of training or test data, such that after observing umpteen amount of data, the differences between these classifiers would be negligible. This is an important result from the practical perspective as under the presence of sufficiently large amount of data, one can replace the simpler marginal classifier with computationally more expensive simultaneous one.

Many studies have investigated efficient methods for algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization. However, methods forMLpipeline synthesis and optimization considering the impact of complex pipeline structures containing multiple preprocessing and classification algorithms have not been studied thoroughly. In this paper, we propose a data-centric approach based on meta-features for pipeline construction and hyperparameter optimization inspired by human behavior. By expanding the pipeline search space incrementally in combination with meta-features of intermediate data sets, we are able to prune the pipeline structure search space efficiently. Consequently, flexible and data set specificMLpipelines can be constructed. We prove the effectiveness and competitiveness of our approach ondata sets used in well-establishedAutoMLbenchmarks in comparison with state-of-the-artAutoMLframeworks.

Users often use figurative language, such as sarcasm, either as persuasive devices or to attack the opponent by an ad hominem argument. To further our understanding of the role of sarcasm in shaping the disagreement space, we present a thorough experimental setup using a corpus annotated with both argumentative moves (agree/disagree) and sarcasm. We exploit joint modeling in terms of (a) applying discrete features that are useful in detecting sarcasm to the task of argumentative relation classification (agree/disagree/none), and (b) multitask learning for argumentative relation classification and sarcasm detection using deep learning architectures (e.g., dual Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with hierarchical attention and Transformer-based architectures). We demonstrate that modeling sarcasm improves the argumentative relation classification task (agree/disagree/none) in all setups.

However, as it is difficult to detect a fake rating, attackers can potentially impact the rating’s aggregated score unfairly. This malicious behavior can negatively affect users and businesses. To overcome this problem, we take a mechanism-design approach to increase the cost of fake ratings while providing incentives for honest ratings. Our proposed mechanismRewardRatingis inspired by the stock market model in which users can invest in their ratings for services and receive a reward based on future ratings. First, we formally model the problem and discuss budget-balanced and incentive-compatibility specifications. Then, we suggest a profit-sharing scheme to cover the rating system’s requirements. Finally, we analyze the performance of our proposed mechanism.	Mechanism Design Fake Rating Sybil Attack Profit Sharing

Accurate and efficient video quality predictors suitable for this content are thus in great demand to achieve more intelligent analysis and processing of UGC videos. Previous studies have shown that natural scene statistics and deep learning features are both sufficient to capture spatial distortions, which contribute to a significant aspect of UGC video quality issues. However, these models are either incapable or inefficient for predicting the quality of complex and diverse UGC videos in practical applications. Here we introduce an effective and efficient video quality model for UGC content, which we dub the Rapid and Accurate Video Quality Evaluator (RAPIQUE), which we show performs comparably to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models but with orders-of-magnitude faster runtime. RAPIQUE combines and leverages the advantages of both quality-aware scene statistics features and semantics-aware deep convolutional features, allowing us to design the first general and efficient spatial and temporal (space-time) bandpass statistics model for video quality modeling. Our experimental results on recent large-scale UGC video quality databases show that RAPIQUE delivers top performances on all the datasets at a considerably lower computational expense. We hope this work promotes and inspires further efforts towards practical modeling of video quality problems for potential real-time and low-latency applications. To promote public usage, an implementation of RAPIQUE has been made freely available online:https://github.com/vztu/RAPIQUE.

Rule-Based-Methods (RBMs) represent a commonly used strategy to include cardiac fibers in computational models. A particular class of such methods is known as Laplace-Dirichlet-Rule-Based-Methods (LDRBMs) since they rely on the solution of Laplace problems. In this work we provide a unified framework, based on LDRBMs, for generating full heart muscle fibers. First, wereview existing ventricular LDRBMs providing a communal mathematical descriptionand introducing also some modeling improvements with respect to the existing literature. We then carry out a systematic comparison of LDRBMs based on meaningful biomarkers produced by numerical EP simulations. Next we propose, for the first time, a LDRBM to be used for generating atrial fibers. The new method, tested both on idealized and realistic atrial models, can be applied to any arbitrary geometries. Finally, we present numerical results obtained in a realistic whole heart where fibers are included for all the four chambers using the discussed LDRBMs.	Cardiac fiber architecture | Fiber reconstruction | Laplace-Dirichlet-Rule-Based-Methods | Mathematical models | Electrophysiology simulation | Finite element method.

Inferring serial correlation for such data is a fundamental challenge in statistics. We propose a total variation constrained least square estimator coupled with hypothesis tests to infer the serial correlation in the presence of unknown and unstructured dynamic background. The total variation constraint on the dynamic background encourages a piece-wise constant structure, which can approximate a wide range of dynamic backgrounds. The tuning parameter is selected via the Ljung-Box test to control the bias-variance trade-off. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound for the estimation error through variational inequalities. We also derive a lower error bound via Fano’s method and show the proposed method is near-optimal. Numerical simulation and a real study in psychology demonstrate the excellent performance of our proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art.

Our goal is to investigate the balance between the metabolic costs of larger brains compared to the advantage they provide in solving general and combinatorial problems. Defining advantage as the performance relative to competitors, a two-player game based on the knapsack problem is used. Within this framework, two opponents compete over shared resources, with the goal of collecting more resources than the opponent. Neural nets of varying sizes are trained using a variant of the AlphaGo Zero algorithm[1]. A surprisingly simple relation,, is found for the relative win rate of a net withneurons against one with. Success increases linearly with investments in additional resources when the networks sizes are very different, i.e. when, with returns diminishing when both networks become comparable in size.

Maier	Computational Sciences and Engineering Division Oak Ridge National Laboratory Oak Ridge TN 37831-6494 USAInstitute for Theoretical Physics ETH Zurich 8093 Zurich SwitzerlandDepartment of Physics and Astronomy University of Tennessee Knoxville Tennessee 37996-1200 USA		We study the three-band Hubbard model for the copper oxide plane of the high-temperature superconducting cuprates using determinant quantum Monte Carlo and the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) and provide a comprehensive view of the pairing correlations in this model using these methods. Specifically, we compute the pair-field susceptibility and study its dependence on temperature, doping, interaction strength, and charge-transfer energy. Using the DCA, we also solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-particle Green’s function in the particle-particle channel to determine the transition temperature to the superconducting phase on smaller clusters. Our calculations reproduce many aspects of the cuprate phase diagram and indicate that there is an “optimal” value of the charge-transfer energy for the model whereis largest. These results have implications for our understanding of superconductivity in both the cuprates and other doped charge-transfer insulators.

As in most normal galaxies, the [C ii] emission is generally consistent with emission from cooling gas excited by photoelectric heating in photo-dissociation regions. However, anomalously high [C ii]/CO ratios are seen at the two ends of the counter-arms. Both ends show shell-like structures, possibly bubbles, in Hemission. In addition, the southern end has [C ii] to infrared emission ratios inconsistent with normal star formation. Because there is little H i emission at this location, the [C ii] emission probably originates in warm shocked molecular gas heated by the interaction of the radio jet forming the counter-arms with the interstellar medium in the galaxy. At two other locations, the high [C ii]/CO ratios provide evidence for the existence of patches of CO-dark molecular gas. The [C ii] and CO observations also reveal resolved velocity components along the bar. In particular, the CO emission can be separated into two components associated to gas along the leading edge of the bar and gas trailing the bar. The trailing gas component that amounts to approximately 40% of the gas around the bar region may be related to a minor merger.

[2101.10967] Robustness of Iteratively Pre-Conditioned Gradient-Descent Method: The Case of Distributed Linear Regression Problem	Kushal Chakrabarti Nirupam Gupta and Nikhil Chopra		kchak@terpmail.umd.edu nirupam115@gmail.com nchopra@umd.edu	This paper considers the problem of multi-agent distributed linear regression in the presence of system noises. In this problem, the system comprises multiple agents wherein each agent locally observes a set of data points, and the agents’ goal is to compute a linear model that best fits the collective data points observed by all the agents. We consider a server-based distributed architecture where the agents interact with a common server to solve the problem; however, the server cannot access the agents’ data points. We consider a practical scenario wherein the system either hasobservation noise, i.e., the data points observed by the agents are corrupted, or hasprocess noise, i.e., the computations performed by the server and the agents are corrupted. In noise-free systems, the recently proposed distributed linear regression algorithm, named the Iteratively Pre-conditioned Gradient-descent (IPG) method, has been claimed to converge faster than related methods. In this paper, we study therobustnessof the IPG method, against both theobservation noiseand theprocess noise. We empirically show that the robustness of the IPG method compares favorably to the state-of-the-art algorithms.

An ingredient in the proof is the definability of the mixed period mapping obtained by Bakker-Brunebarbe-Klingler-Tsimerman. In comparison with preceding results, in the point counting step, we count rational points on definable quotients instead.	
[2101.10969] Ratio of flavour non-singlet and singlet scalar density renormalisation parameters in 𝑁_f=3 QCD with Wilson quarks	Jochen Heitger Fabian Joswig Pia L. J. Petrak Anastassios Vladikas			We determine non-perturbatively the normalisation factor, whereandare the renormalisation parameters of the flavour non-singlet and singlet scalar densities, respectively. This quantity is required in the computation of quark masses with Wilson fermions and for instance the renormalisation of nucleon matrix elements of scalar densities. Our calculation involves simulations of finite-volume lattice QCD with the tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action,mass-degenerateimproved Wilson fermions and Schrödinger functional boundary conditions. The slope of the current quark mass, as a function of the subtracted Wilson quark mass is extracted both in a unitary setup (where nearly chiral valence and sea quark masses are degenerate) and in a non-unitary setup (where all valence flavours are chiral and the sea quark masses are small). These slopes are then combined within order to obtain. A novel chiral Ward identity is employed for the calculation of the normalisation factor. Our results cover the range of gauge couplings corresponding to lattice spacings belowfm, for whichQCD simulations in large volumes with the same lattice action are typically performed.

[2101.10973] Tell Me Who Your Friends Are: Using Content Sharing Behavior for News Source Veracity Detection	Maurício Gruppi Benjamin D. Horne Sibel Adalı	of Computer ScienceRensselaer Polytechnic InstituteTroyNYUSA12180	adalis@rpi.edu bhorne6@utk.edu gouvem@rpi.edu	Stopping the malicious spread and production of false and misleading news has become a top priority for researchers. Due to this prevalence, many automated methods for detecting low quality information have been introduced. The majority of these methods have used article-level features, such as their writing style, to detect veracity. While writing style models have been shown to work well in lab-settings, there are concerns of generalizability and robustness. In this paper, we begin to address these concerns by proposing a novel and robust news veracity detection model that uses the content sharing behavior of news sources formulated as a network. We represent these content sharing networks (CSN) using a deep walk based method for embedding graphs that accounts for similarity in both the network space and the article text space. We show that state of the art writing style and CSN features make diverse mistakes when predicting, meaning that they both play different roles in the classification task. Moreover, we show that the addition of CSN features increases the accuracy of writing style models, boosting accuracy as much as 14% when using Random Forests. Similarly, we show that the combination of hand-crafted article-level features and CSN features is robust to concept drift, performing consistently well over a 10-month time frame.

The proof uses a semiclassical estimate on the spectral gap of an equivariant Berezin transform to extend a strategy due to Donaldson, and can be seen as the quantization of a method due to Tian and Zhu, using quantized Futaki invariants as obstructions for quantized Kähler-Ricci solitons. As corollaries, we recover the uniqueness of Kähler-Ricci solitons up to automorphisms, and show how our result also applies to Kähler-Einstein Fano manifolds with general automorphism group.

Self-training is a competitive approach in domain adaptive segmentation, which trains the network with the pseudo labels on the target domain. However inevitably, the pseudo labels are noisy and the target features are dispersed due to the discrepancy between source and target domains. In this paper, we rely on representative prototypes, the feature centroids of classes, to address the two issues for unsupervised domain adaptation. In particular, we take one step further and exploit the feature distances from prototypes that provide richer information than mere prototypes. Specifically, we use it to estimate the likelihood of pseudo labels to facilitate online correction in the course of training. Meanwhile, we align the prototypical assignments based on relative feature distances for two different views of the same target, producing a more compact target feature space. Moreover, we find that distilling the already learned knowledge to a self-supervised pretrained model further boosts the performance. Our method shows tremendous performance advantage over state-of-the-art methods. We will make the code publicly available.

[2101.10981] Ridesharing and Fleet Sizing For On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems	Ramon Auad Pascal Van Hentenryck	institutetext:	rauad@gatech.edu ramon.auad@gmail.com rauad@ucn.cl pascal.vanhentenryck@isye.gatech.edu	This paper considers the design of On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems (ODMTS) that combine fixed bus/rail routes between transit hubs with on-demand shuttles that serve the first/last miles to/from the hubs. The design problem aims at finding a network design for the fixed routes to allow a set of riders to travel from their origins to their destinations, while minimizing the sum of the travel costs, the bus operating costs, and rider travel times. The paper addresses two gaps in existing tools for designing ODMTS. First, it generalizes prior work by including ridesharing in the shuttle rides. Second, it proposes novel fleet-sizing algorithms for determining the number of shuttles needed to meet the performance metrics of the ODMTS design. Both contributions are based on Mixed-Integer Programs (MIP). For the ODMTS design, the MIP reasons about pickup and dropoff routes in order to capture ridesharing, grouping riders who travel to/from the same hub. The fleet-sizing optimization is modeled as a minimum flow problem with covering constraints. The natural formulation leads to a dense graph and computational issues, which is addressed by a reformulation that works on a sparse graph. The methodological contributions are evaluated on a real case study: the public transit system of the broader Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti region in Michigan. The results demonstrate the substantial potential of ridesharing for ODMTS, as costs are reduced by about 26% with respect to allowing only individual shuttle rides, at the expense of a minimal increase in transit times. Compared to the existing system, the designed ODMTS also cuts down costs by 35% and reduces transit times by 38%.

Estados Unidos, 154, 37504-364, Itajubá, MG, Brazil	E-mail:	filipe1906@ufmg.br	We report the discovery of 34 new open clusters and candidates as a result of a systematic search carried out in 200 adjacent fields of 11 degarea projected towards the Galactic bulge, usingGaiaDR2 data. The objects were identified and characterized by a joint analysis of their photometric, kinematic and spatial distribution, which has been consistently used and proved to be effective in our previous works. The discoveries were validated by cross-referencing the objects position and astrometric parameters with the available literature. Besides their coordinates and astrometric parameters, we also provide sizes, ages, distances and reddening for the discovered objects. In particular, 32 clusters are closer than 2 kpc from the Sun, which represents an increment of nearlyof objects with astrophysical parameters determined in the nearby inner disk. Although these objects fill an important gap in the open clusters distribution along the Sagittarius arm, this arm, traced by known clusters, appears to be interrupted, which may be an artifact due to the incompleteness of the cluster census.

We show that an-covered transversely orientable foliation with Gromov hyperbolic leaves in a closed-manifold admits a regulating, transverse pseudo-Anosov flow (in the appropriate sense) in each atoroidal piece of the manifold. The flow is a blow up of a one prong pseudo-Anosov flow. In addition we show that there is a regulating flow for the whole foliation. We also determine how deck transformations act on the universal circle of the foliation.

U’Ren		omar.calderon@correo.nucleares.unam.mx roberto.leon@nucleares.unam.mx	Entangled two-photon absorption (ETPA) has recently become a topic of lively debate, mainly due to the apparent inconsistencies in the experimentally-reported ETPA cross sections of organic molecules. In this work, we provide a thorough experimental study of ETPA in the organic molecules Rhodamine B (RhB) and Zinc Tetraphenylporphirin (ZnTPP). The goal of this contribution is twofold: on one hand, it seeks to reproduce the results of previous experimental reports and, on the other, it aims to determine the effects of different temporal correlations —introduced as a controllable time-delay between the photons to be absorbed— on the strength of the ETPA signal. In our experiment, the samples are excited by entangled pairs produced by type-I SPDC, with a spectral distribution centered at 810 nm. Surprisingly, and contrary to what was expected, the time delay did not produce in our experiments any systematic change in the cross-sections when monitoring the ETPA signal using a transmission measurement scheme. As a plausible cause of this unexpected result, we argue that the photon-pair flux, typically-used in these experiments, is not sufficient to promote the two-photon absorption process in these molecules. This suggests that the actual absorption cross-section values are lower than those previously reported, and therefore do not lead to a measurable ETPA effect for the transmission method.

We then characterize the embedding of any regular category into its completion and use this to obtain examples of concrete categories which arise as such completions. In particular, we prove that the exact completion in this enriched sense of both the categories of Stone and Priestley spaces is the category of compact ordered spaces of L. Nachbin. Finally, we consider the relationship between the enriched exact completion and categories of internal posets in ordinary categories.

Bower Mark Hammond Ryan Boukrouche Patrick Sanan Shang-Min Tsai Raymond T. Pierrehumbert	Atmospheric Oceanic and Planetary Physics Department of Physics University of Oxford United KingdomTim	tim.lichtenberg@physics.ox.ac.uk	The earliest atmospheres of rocky planets originate from extensive volatile release during magma ocean epochs that occur during assembly of the planet. These establish the initial distribution of the major volatile elements between different chemical reservoirs that subsequently evolve via geological cycles. Current theoretical techniques are limited in exploring the anticipated range of compositional and thermal scenarios of early planetary evolution, even though these are of prime importance to aid astronomical inferences on the environmental context and geological history of extrasolar planets. Here, we present a coupled numerical framework that links an evolutionary, vertically-resolved model of the planetary silicate mantle with a radiative-convective model of the atmosphere. Using this method we investigate the early evolution of idealized Earth-sized rocky planets with end-member, clear-sky atmospheres dominated by either H, HO, CO, CH, CO, O, or N. We find central metrics of early planetary evolution, such as energy gradient, sequence of mantle solidification, surface pressure, or vertical stratification of the atmosphere, to be intimately controlled by the dominant volatile and outgassing history of the planet. Thermal sequences fall into three general classes with increasing cooling timescale: CO, N, and Owith minimal effect, HO, CO, and CHwith intermediate influence, and Hwith several orders of magnitude increase in solidification time and atmosphere vertical stratification. Our numerical experiments exemplify the capabilities of the presented modeling framework and link the interior and atmospheric evolution of rocky exoplanets with multi-wavelength astronomical observations.

First, we address the problem from the point of view of a “manager” who seeks to derive the optimal strategy of the team in a centralized process. We derive structural results that yield an information state for the team which does not depend on the control strategy, and thus it can lead to a dynamic programming decomposition where the optimization problem is over the space of the team’s decisions. We, then, derive structural results for each team member that yield an information state which does not depend on their control strategy, and thus it can lead to a dynamic programming decomposition where the optimization problem for each team member is over the space of their decisions. Finally, we show that the control strategy of each team member is the same as the one derived by the manager. We present an illustrative example of a dynamic team with a delayed sharing information structure.

[2101.10993] Shear Induced Orientational Ordering in Active Glass	Rituparno Mandal Peter Sollich	Institute for Theoretical Physics Georg-August-Universität Göttingen 37077 Göttingen Germany.		Dense assemblies of self propelled particles, also known as active or living glasses are abundant around us, covering different length and time scales: from the cytoplasm to tissues, from bacterial bio-films to vehicular traffic jams, from Janus colloids to animal herds. Being structurally disordered as well as strongly out of equilibrium, these systems show fascinating dynamical and mechanical properties. Using extensive molecular dynamics simulation and a number of different dynamical and mechanical order parameters we differentiate three dynamical steady states in a sheared model active glassy system: (a) a disordered phase, (b) a propulsion-induced ordered phase, and (c) a shear-induced ordered phase. We supplement these observations with an analytical theory based on an effective single particle Fokker-Planck description to rationalise the existence of the novel shear-induced orientational ordering behaviour in our model active glassy system that has no explicit aligning interactions,e.g.of Vicsek-type. This ordering phenomenon occurs in the large persistence time limit and is made possible only by the applied steady shear. Using a Fokker-Planck description we make testable predictions without any fit parameters for the joint distribution of single particle position and orientation. These predictions match well with the joint distribution measured from direct numerical simulation. Our results are of relevance for experiments exploring the rheological response of dense active colloids and jammed active granular matter systems.

State-of-the-art methods typically encode the SDF with a large, fixed-size neural network to approximate complex shapes with implicit surfaces. Rendering with these large networks is, however, computationally expensive since it requires many forward passes through the network for every pixel, making these representations impractical for real-time graphics. We introduce an efficient neural representation that, for the first time, enables real-time rendering of high-fidelity neural SDFs, while achieving state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction quality. We represent implicit surfaces using an octree-based feature volume which adaptively fits shapes with multiple discrete levels of detail (LODs), and enables continuous LOD with SDF interpolation. We further develop an efficient algorithm to directly render our novel neural SDF representation in real-time by querying only the necessary LODs with sparse octree traversal. We show that our representation is 2–3 orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of rendering speed compared to previous works. Furthermore, it produces state-of-the-art reconstruction quality for complex shapes under both 3D geometric and 2D image-space metrics.

Eugene Wayne			In this article we prove the existence of a new family of periodic solutions for discrete, nonlinear Schrödinger equations subject to spatially localized driving and damping. They provide an alternate description of the metastable behavior in such lattice systems which agrees with previous predictions for the evolution of metastable states while providing more accurate approximations to these states. We analyze the stability of these breathers, finding a very small positive eigenvalue whose eigenvector lies almost tangent to the surface of the cylinder formed by the family of breathers. This causes solutions to slide along the cylinder without leaving its neighborhood for very long times.

Terrien	of Astronomy The University of Texas at Austin 2515 Speedway Stop C1400 Austin TX 78712 USA	quangtran@utexas.edu	We present early results from the Epoch of Giant Planet Migration program, a precise RV survey of over one hundred intermediate-age (20–200 Myr) G and K dwarfs with the Habitable–Zone Planet Finder spectrograph (HPF) at McDonald Observatory’s Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). The goals of this program are to determine the timescale and dominant physical mechanism of giant planet migration interior to the water ice line of Sun-like stars. Here, we summarize results from the first 14 months of this program, with a focus on our custom RV pipeline for HPF, a measurement of the intrinsic near-infrared RV activity of young Solar analogs, and modeling the underlying population-level distribution of stellar jitter. We demonstrate on-sky stability at the sub-2 m slevel for the K2 standard HD 3765 using a least-squares matching method to extract precise RVs. Based on a subsample of 29 stars with at least three RV measurements from our program, we find a median RMS level of 34 m s. This is nearly a factor of 2 lower than the median RMS level in the optical of 60 m sfor a comparison sample with similar ages and spectral types as our targets. The observed near-infrared jitter measurements for this subsample are well reproduced with a log-normal parent distribution withand. Finally, by compiling RMS values from previous planet search programs, we show that near-infrared jitter for G and K dwarfs generally decays with age in a similar fashion to optical wavelengths, albeit with a shallower slope and lower overall values for ages1 Gyr.

We find that the CO(=98) luminosity is higher than expected based on the far-infrared luminosity when compared to nearby star-forming galaxies. Together with the strength of the OHemission components, this may suggest that shock excitation of warm, dense molecular gas is more prevalent in distant massive dusty starbursts than in nearby star-forming galaxies on average, perhaps due to an impact of galactic winds on the gas. OHabsorption is found to be ubiquitous in massive high-redshift starbursts, and is detected toward 89% of the sample. The majority of the sample shows evidence for outflows or inflows based on the velocity shifts of the OHabsorption/emission, with a comparable occurrence rate of both at the resolution of our observations. A small subsample appears to show outflow velocities in excess of their escape velocities. Thus, starburst-driven feedback appears to be important in the evolution of massive galaxies in their most active phases. We find a correlation between the OHabsorption optical depth and the dust temperature, which may suggest that warmer starbursts are more compact and have higher cosmic ray energy densities, leading to more efficient OHion production. This is in agreement with a picture in which these high-redshift galaxies are “scaled-up” versions of the most intense nearby starbursts.	active galaxies; galaxy evolution; starburst galaxies; high-redshift galaxies; infrared excess galaxies; interstellar line emission; submillimeter astronomy; millimeter astronomy

[2101.11008] Spillway Preheating	JiJi Fan Kaloian D. Lozanov Qianshu Lu	institutetext:	klozanov@illinois.edu jiji_fan@brown.edu qianshu_lu@g.harvard.edu	In traditional models only an order one fraction of energy is transferred from the inflaton to radiation through nonperturbative resonance production in preheating immediately after inflation, due to backreaction effects. We propose a particle production mechanism that could improve the depletion of the inflaton energy density by up to four orders of magnitude. The improvement comes from the fast perturbative decays of resonantly produced daughter particles. They act as a “spillway” to drain these daughter particles, reducing their backreaction on the inflaton and keeping the resonant production effective for a longer period. Thus we dub the scenario “spillway preheating”. We also show that the fraction of energy density remaining in the inflaton has a simple inverse power-law scaling in the scenario. In general, spillway preheating is a much more efficient energy dissipation mechanism, which may have other applications in model building for particle physics.	
[2101.11009] The Perseus ALMA Chemistry Survey (PEACHES). I. The Complex Organic Molecules in Perseus Embedded Protostars	Yao-Lun Yang Nami Sakai Yichen Zhang Nadia M. Murillo Ziwei E. Zhang Aya E. Higuchi Shaoshan Zeng Ana López-Sepulcre Satoshi Yamamoto Bertrand Lefloch Mathilde Bouvier Cecilia Ceccarelli Tomoya Hirota Muneaki Imai Yoko Oya Takeshi Sakai Yoshimasa Watanabe	Department of Astronomy University of Virginia Charlottesville VA 22904-4235 USARIKEN Cluster for Pioneering Research Wako-shi Saitama 351-0106 Japan	yaolunyang.astro@gmail.com	To date, about two dozen low-mass embedded protostars exhibit rich spectra with lines of complex organic molecule (COM). These protostars seem to possess different enrichment in COMs. However, the statistics of COM abundance in low-mass protostars are limited by the scarcity of observations. This study introduces the Perseus ALMA Chemistry Survey (PEACHES), which aims at unbiasedly characterizing the chemistry of COMs toward the embedded (Class 0/I) protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud. Of 50 embedded protostars surveyed, 58% of them have emission from COMs. A 56%, 32%, and 40% of the protostars haveCHOH,CHOCHO, and N-bearing COMs, respectively. The detectability of COMs depends neither on the averaged continuum brightness temperature, a proxy of the Hcolumn density, nor on the bolometric luminosity and the bolometric temperature. For the protostars with detected COMs,CHOHhas a tight correlation withCHCN, spanning more than two orders of magnitude in column densities normalized by the continuum brightness temperature, suggesting a chemical relation betweenCHOHandCHCNand a large chemical diversity in the PEACHES samples at the same time. A similar trend with more scatter is also found between all identified COMs, hinting at a common chemistry for the sources with COMs. The correlation between COMs is insensitive to the protostellar properties, such as the bolometric luminosity and the bolometric temperature. The abundance of larger COMs (CHOCHOandCHOCH) relative to that of smaller COMs (CHOHandCHCN) increases with the inferred gas column density, hinting at an efficient production of complex species in denser envelopes.

[2101.11010] Thermodynamics of 𝑑-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes in the canonical ensemble	Rui André José P. S. Lemos	de Astrofísica e Gravitação - CENTRA Departamento de Física Instituto Superior Técnico - IST Universidade de Lisboa - UL Av. Rovisco Pais 1 1049-001 Lisboa Portugal	joselemos@tecnico.ulisboa.pt rui.andre@tecnico.ulisboa.pt	We study the thermodynamics of a-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, also known as a Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole, in the canonical ensemble. This generalizes York’s formalism, which has been initially applied to four dimensions and later to five dimensions, to any numberof dimensions. The canonical ensemble, characterized by a cavity of fixed radiusand fixed temperatureat the boundary, allows for two possible black hole solutions in thermal equilibrium, a smaller black hole and a larger black hole. In four and five dimensions, these solutions have a direct exact form, whereas in an arbitrary number of dimensions, one is compelled to resort to approximation schemes or numerical calculations. From the Euclidean action and the path integral approach, we obtain the free energy, the thermodynamic energy, the thermodynamic pressure, and the entropy, of the black hole plus cavity system. The entropy of the system is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. The analysis of the heat capacity of the system shows that the smaller black hole is in unstable equilibrium and the larger black hole is in stable equilibrium. The-dimensional photon sphere radius divides the stability criterion. Indeed, if the cavity’s radius is larger than the photon sphere radius, and so the black hole is small, the system is unstable, if the cavity’s radius is smaller than the photon sphere radius, and so the black hole is large, the system is stable. To study perturbations on the system, a generalized free energy function is obtained that also allows one to understand the possible phase transitions between classical hot flat space and the black holes. The Buchdahl radius, that appears naturally in the general relativistic study of star structure, also shows up in our context, the free energy is zero when the cavity’s radius has the-dimensional Buchdahl radius value. Then, if the cavity’s radius is larger than the Buchdahl radius, classical hot flat space phase cannot make a phase transition to a black hole phase, and if smaller, classical hot flat space can nucleate a black hole. The roles of both the photon sphere and the Buchdahl limit are present for every dimension, indicating that, besides their known role in dynamics, these radii also play a role in the thermodynamics of gravitational systems. The close link between the canonical analysis performed and the direct perturbation of the path integral is also pointed out. Since hot flat space is a quantum system made purely of gravitons, if only gravitation is considered, it is of great interest to compare the-dimensional free energies of quantum hot flat space and the stable black hole to find for which ranges ofand, the quantities that characterize the canonical ensemble, one phase predominates over the other. Phase diagrams for a few different dimensions are displayed. The density of states at a given energy is found through an inverse Laplace transformation giving back the entropy of the stable black hole. Several side calculations and further deliberations are performed, namely, the calculation for the approximate expressions for the canonical ensemble black hole horizon radii, a brief study of the photon orbit radius and the Buchdahl radius in the-dimensional Schwarzschild solution, a connection to the thermodynamics of thin shells inspacetime dimensions which are systems that are also apt to a rigorous thermodynamic study, a presentation of quantum hot flat space inspacetime dimensions as a thermodynamic system, an analysis of classical hot flat space inspacetime dimensions as a product of quantum hot flat space with the black hole transitions and the corresponding phase diagrams for a few different dimensions, and a synopsis with the relevance of the work. It is still worth mentioning that the comparison of the thermodynamics of-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes and classical hot flat space in the canonical ensemble with the thermodynamics of spherical thin shells indimensions yields a striking direct matching between the two systems, most notably that the photon sphere radius appears here as a thermodynamic stability divisor in both systems, and the Buchdahl radius that appears on thermodynamic grounds for canonical black holes appears also as a thermodynamic and as a dynamical radius for thin shells.

For this inference, we use the local star formation histories to estimate the age for each supernova (SN). These star formation histories often show multiple bursts of star formation; our model assumes that one burst is associated with the SN progenitor and the others are random bursts of star formation. The primary inference is the progenitor age distribution. Due to the limited number of historic SNe and highly uncertain star formation at young ages, we restrict our inference to the slope of the age distribution and the maximum age for CCSNe. Using single-star evolutionary models, we transform the progenitor age distribution into a progenitor mass distribution. Under these assumptions, the minimum mass for CCSNe isand the slope of the progenitor mass distribution is. The power-law slope for the progenitor mass distribution is consistent with the standard Salpeter initial mass function (). These values are consistent with previous estimates using precursor imaging and the age-dating technique, further confirming that using stellar populations around SN and supernova remnants is a reliable way to infer the progenitor masses.	stars: massive – supernovae: general – methods: statistical

Indeed, they are often dominated by bright star-forming structures of masses up todubbed «giant clumps». However, recent observations questioned this result by showing only low-mass structures or no structure at all. We use Adaptative Mesh Refinement hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies with parsec-scale resolution to study the formation of structures inside clumpy high-redshift galaxies. We show that in very gas-rich galaxies star formation occurs in small gas clusters with masses belowthat are themselves located inside giant complexes with masses up toand sometimes. Those massive structures are similar in mass and size to the giant clumps observed in imaging surveys, in particular with the Hubble Space Telescope. Using mock observations of simulated galaxies, we show that at very high resolution with instruments like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array or through gravitational lensing, only low-mass structures are likely to be detected, and their gathering into giant complexes might be missed. This leads to the non-detection of the giant clumps and therefore introduces a bias in the detection of these structures. We show that the simulated giant clumps can be gravitationally bound even when undetected in mocks representative for ALMA observations and HST observations of lensed galaxies. We then compare the top-down fragmentation of an initially warm disc and the bottom-up fragmentation of an initially cold disc to show that the process of formation of the clumps does not impact their physical properties.	galaxy evolution – high redshift

[2101.11015] Anomalies in the gravitational recoil of eccentric black-hole mergers with unequal mass ratios	Miren Radia Ulrich Sperhake Emanuele Berti Robin Croft	of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics Centre for Mathematical Sciences University of Cambridge Wilberforce Road Cambridge CB3 0WA United Kingdom	m.r.radia@damtp.cam.ac.uk u.sperhake@damtp.cam.ac.uk berti@jhu.edu	The radiation of linear momentum imparts a recoil (or “kick”) to the center of mass of a merging black-hole binary system. Recent numerical relativity calculations have shown that eccentricity can lead to an approximate 25% increase in recoil velocities for equal-mass, spinning binaries with spins lying in the orbital plane (“superkick” configurations) [U. Sperhake et al.Phys. Rev. D101(2020) 024044]. Here we investigate the impact of nonzero eccentricity on the kick magnitude and gravitational-wave emission of nonspinning, unequal-mass black hole binaries. We confirm that nonzero eccentricities at merger can lead to kicks which are larger by up torelative to the quasicircular case. We also find that the kick velocityhas an oscillatory dependence on eccentricity, which we interpret as a consequence of changes in the angle between the infall direction at merger and the apoapsis (or periapsis) direction.	
[2101.11016] Explaining Excess Dipole in NVSS Data Using Superhorizon Perturbation	Kaustav K. Das Kishan Sankharva Pankaj Jain			Many observations in recent times have shown evidence against the standard assumption of isotropy in the Big Bang model. Introducing a superhorizon scalar metric perturbation has been able to explain some of these anomalies. In this work, we probe the net velocity arising due to the perturbation. We find that this extra component does not contribute to the CMB dipole amplitude while it does contribute to the dipole in large scale structures. Thus, within this model’s framework, our velocity with respect to the large scale structure is not the same as that extracted from the CMB dipole, assuming it to be of purely kinematic origin. Taking this extra velocity component into account, we study the superhorizon mode’s implications for the excess dipole observed in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). We find that the mode can consistently explain both the CMB and NVSS observations. We also find that the model leads to small contributions to the local bulk flow and the dipole in Hubble parameter, which are consistent with observations. The model leads to several predictions which can be tested in future surveys. In particular, it implies that the observed dipole in large scale structure should be redshift dependent and should show an increase in amplitude with redshift. We also find that the Hubble parameter should show a dipole anisotropy whose amplitude must increase with redshift in the CMB frame. Similar anisotropic behaviour is expected for the observed redshift as a function of the luminosity distance.	
[2101.11017] Measuring time delays: I. Using a flux time series that is a linear combination of time-shifted light curves	Ofer M. Springer,Eran O. OfekDepartment of Particle Physics and Astrophysics, Weizmann Institute of Science, 76100 Rehovot, Israel.Benin School of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 9190416 Jerusalem, Israel	E-mail:	eran.ofek@weizmann.ac.il	Several phenomena in astrophysics generate light curves with time delays. Among these are reverberation mapping, and lensed quasars. In some of these systems, the measurement of the time-delay is complicated by the fact that the delayed components are unresolved and that the light curves are generated from a red-noise process. We derive the likelihood function of the observations given a model of either a combination of time-delayed light curves or a single light curve (i.e., the null hypothesis). This likelihood function is different from the auto-correlation function investigated by previous studies. We demonstrate that given a single-band light curve that is a linear combination of two (or more) time-shifted copies of an original light curve, generated from a red-noise probability distribution, it is possible to test if the total-flux light curve is a composition of time-delayed copies or, alternatively, is consistent with being a single copy of the original light curve. We also demonstrate that, in some realistic cases, it is possible to measure the time delays and flux ratios between these unresolved components even when the flux ratio is about. In the era of synoptic sky surveys, this method is useful for identifying lensed quasars and simultaneously measuring their time delays, and also for estimating the reverberation time scales of active galactic nuclei. In a companion paper, we build on these results to derive another method that uses the center-of-light astrometric position (e.g., of a lensed quasar) along with the combined flux. The combined flux and astrometry allow us to identify lensed quasars and supernovae and measure their time delays, with potentially higher fidelity compared to the flux-only method described in the current work. The astrometryflux method, however, is not suitable for quasar reverberation mapping. We also comment on the commonly used method of fitting a power-law model to a power spectrum, and present the proper likelihood function for such a fit. We test the new method on simulations and provide Python and MATLAB implementations.	quasars: supermassive black holes – gravitational lensing: strong – methods: statistical – software: data analysis
[2101.11018] Accurate and Efficient Simulations of Hamiltonian Mechanical Systems with Discontinuous Potentials	Molei Tao Shi Jin	School of Mathematics Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta GA 30332 USA.	shijin-m@sjtu.edu.cn mtao@gatech.edu	This article considers Hamiltonian mechanical systems with potential functions admitting jump discontinuities. The focus is on accurate and efficient numerical approximations of their solutions, which will be defined via the laws of reflection and refraction. Despite of the success of symplectic integrators for smooth mechanical systems, their construction for the discontinuous ones is nontrivial, and numerical convergence order can be impaired too. Several rather-usable numerical methods are proposed, including: a first-order symplectic integrator for general problems, a third-order symplectic integrator for problems with only one linear interface, arbitrarily high-order reversible integrators for general problems (no longer symplectic), and an adaptive time-stepping version of the previous high-order method. Interestingly, whether symplecticity leads to favorable long time performance is no longer clear due to discontinuity, as traditional Hamiltonian backward error analysis does not apply any more. Therefore, at this stage, our recommended default method is the last one. Various numerical evidence, on the order of convergence, long time performance, momentum map conservation, and consistency with the computationally-expensive penalty method, are supplied. A complex problem, namely the Sauteed Mushroom, is also proposed and numerically investigated, for which multiple bifurcations between trapped and ergodic dynamics are observed.	
[2101.11019] Twin Higgs Portal Dark Matter	David Curtin Shayne Gryba	institutetext:	dcurtin@physics.utoronto.ca sgryba@physics.utoronto.ca	Many minimal models of dark matter (DM) or canonical solutions to the hierarchy problem are either excluded or severely constrained by LHC and direct detection null results. In particular, Higgs Portal Dark Matter (HPDM) features a scalar coupling to the Higgs via a quartic interaction, and obtaining the measured relic density via thermal freeze-out gives definite direct detection predictions which are now almost entirely excluded. The Twin Higgs solves the little hierarchy problem without coloured top partners by introducing a twin sector related to the Standard Model (SM) by a discrete symmetry. We generalize HPDM to arbitrary Twin Higgs models and introduceTwin Higgs Portal Dark Matter(THPDM), which features a DM candidate with an-invariant quartic coupling to the Twin Higgs scalar sector. Given the size of quadratic corrections to the DM mass, its most motivated scale is near the mass of the radial mode. In that case, DM annihilation proceeds with the full Twin Higgs portal coupling, while direct detection is suppressed by the pNGB nature of the 125 GeV Higgs. For a standard cosmological history, this results in a predicted direct detection signal for THPDM that is orders of magnitude below that of HPDM with very little dependence on the precise details of the twin sector, evading current bounds but predicting possible signals at next generation experiments. In many Twin Higgs models, twin radiation contributions toare suppressed by an asymmetric reheating mechanism. We study this by extending theMTH andMTH models to include THPDM and compute the viable parameter space according to the latest CMB bounds. The injected entropy dilutes the DM abundance as well, resulting in additional suppression of direct detection below the neutrino floor.	
[2101.11020] Supervised quantum machine learning models are kernel methods	Maria Schuld	Xanadu Toronto ON M5G 2C8 Canada		With near-term quantum devices available and the race for fault-tolerant quantum computers in full swing, researchers became interested in the question of what happens if we replace a supervised machine learning model with a quantum circuit. While such “quantum models” are sometimes called “quantum neural networks”, it has been repeatedly noted that their mathematical structure is actually much more closely related to kernel methods: they analyse data in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces to which we only have access through inner products revealed by measurements. This technical manuscript summarises and extends the idea of systematically rephrasing supervised quantum models as a kernel method. With this, a lot of near-term and fault-tolerant quantum models can be replaced by a general support vector machine whose kernel computes distances between data-encoding quantum states. Kernel-based training is then guaranteed to find better or equally good quantum models than variational circuit training. Overall, the kernel perspective of quantum machine learning tells us that the way that data is encoded into quantum states is the main ingredient that can potentially set quantum models apart from classical machine learning models.	
[2101.11021] Explaining the scatter in the galaxy mass-metallicity relation with gas flows	Maria L. van Loon, Peter D. Mitchelland Joop SchayeLeiden Observatory, Leiden University, P.O. Box 9513, 2300 RA Leiden, the Netherlands	E-mail:	mvanloon98@gmail.com	The physical origin of the scatter in the relation between galaxy stellar mass and the metallicity of the interstellar medium, i.e. the Mass-Metallicity Relation (MZR), reflects the relative importance of key processes in galaxy evolution. Theeaglecosmological hydrodynamical simulation is used to investigate the correlations between the residuals of the MZR and the residuals of the relations between stellar mass and, respectively, specific inflow, outflow and star formation rate as well as the gas fraction for central galaxies. At low redshift, all these residuals are found to be anti-correlated with the residuals of the MZR for. The correlations between the residuals of the MZR and the residuals of the other relations with mass are interrelated, but we find that gas fraction, specific inflow rate and specific outflow rate all have at least some independent influence on the scatter of the MZR. We find that, while forthe specific mass of the nuclear black hole is most important, forgas fraction and specific inflow rate are the variables that correlate most strongly with the MZR scatter. The timescales involved in the residual correlations and the time that galaxies stay above the MZR are revealed to be a few Gyr. However, most galaxies that are below the MZR athave been below the MZR throughout their lifetimes.	galaxies: formation – galaxies: evolution – metallicity

Most famously, the “G-dwarf problem” highlighted the small number of low-metallicity G-dwarf stars in the Milky Way, which is inconsistent with the simplest picture of a galaxy formed from a “closed box” of gas. It can be resolved by treating the Galaxy as an open system that accretes gas throughout its life. This observation has classically only been made in the Milky Way, but the availability of high-quality spectral data from SDSS-IV MaNGA and the development of new analysis techniques mean that we can now make equivalent measurements for a large sample of spiral galaxies. Our analysis shows that high-mass spirals generically show a similar deficit of low-metallicity stars, implying that the Milky Way’s history of gas accretion is common. By contrast, low-mass spirals show little sign of a G-dwarf problem, presenting the metallicity distribution that would be expected if such systems evolved as pretty much closed boxes. This distinction can be understood from the differing timescales for star formation in galaxies of differing masses.	galaxies: spiral – galaxies: – evolution – galaxies: abundances

The typical image separation of objects lensed by galaxies is of the order of. Therefore, finding the ones with small separations, and measuring their time-delays using ground-based observations is challenging. We suggest a new method to identify lensed quasars and simultaneously measure their time-delays, using seeing-limited synoptic observations in which the lensed quasar images and the lensing galaxy are unresolved. We show that using the light curve of the combined flux, and the astrometric measurements of the center-of-light position of the lensed images, the lensed nature of a quasar can be identified, and its time-delay can be measured. We provide the analytic formalism to do so, taking into account the measurement errors and the fact that the power spectra of quasar light curves is red (i.e., the light curve is highly correlated). We demonstrate our method on simulated data, while its implementation to real data will be presented in future papers. Our simulations suggest that, under reasonable assumptions, the new method can detect unresolved lensed quasars and measure their time delays, even when the image separation is below, or the flux ratio between the faintest and brightest images is as low as 0.03. Python and MATLAB implementations are provided. In a companion paper, we present a method for measuring the time delay using the combined flux observations. Although the flux-only method is less powerful, it may be useful in cases in which the astrometric information is not relevant (e.g., reverberation mapping).	quasars: supermassive black holes – gravitational lensing: strong – methods: statistical – software: data analysis

[2101.11026] The Highest Energy HAWC Sources are Likely Leptonic and Powered by Pulsars	Takahiro Sudoh,11footnotetext:Corresponding author. Tim Linden Dan Hooper	footnotetext:		The HAWC Collaboration has observed gamma rays at energies above 56 TeV from a collection of nine sources. It has been suggested that this emission could be hadronic in nature, requiring that these systems accelerate cosmic-ray protons or nuclei up to PeV-scale energies. In this paper, we instead show that the spectra of these objects favor a leptonic (inverse Compton) origin for their emission. More specifically, the gamma-ray emission from these objects can be straightforwardly accommodated within a model in whichof the host pulsar’s spindown power is transferred into the acceleration of electrons and positrons with a power-law spectrum that extends to several hundred TeV or higher. The spectral break that is observed among these sources is naturally explained within the context of this simple model, and occurs at the energy where the timescale for energy losses matches the age of the pulsar. In contrast, this spectral feature cannot be straightforwardly accommodated in hadronic scenarios. Furthermore, hadronic models predict that these sources should produce more emission at GeV-scale energies than is observed. In light of these considerations, we conclude that HAWC’s highest energy sources should be interpreted as TeV halos or pulsar wind nebulae, which produce their emission through inverse Compton scattering, and are powered by the rotational kinetic energy of their host pulsar.	
[2101.11027] Multimessenger constraints on the dark matter interpretation of the Fermi-LAT Galactic center excess	Mattia Di Mauro Martin Wolfgang Winkler	Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare via P. Giuria 1 10125 Torino 	dimauro.mattia@gmail.com martin.winkler@su.se	An excess ofrays in the data measured by theFermiLarge Area Telescope in the direction of the Galactic center has been reported in several publications. This excess, labeled as the Galactic center excess (GCE), is detected analyzing the data with different interstellar emission models, point source catalogs and analysis techniques. The characteristics of the GCE, recently measured with unprecedented precision, are all compatible with dark matter particles (DM) annihilating in the main halo of our Galaxy, even if other interpretations are still not excluded. We investigate the DM candidates that fit the observed GCE spectrum and spatial morphology. We assume a simple scenario with DM annihilating into a single channel but we inspect also more complicated models with two and three channels. We perform a search for a-ray flux from a list of 48 Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) using state-of-the-art estimation of the DM density in these objects. Since we do not find any significant signal from the dSphs, we put upper limits on the annihilation cross section that result to be compatible with the DM candidate that fits the GCE. However, we find that the GCE DM signal is excluded by the AMS-02flux data for all hadronic and semi-hadronic annihilation channels unless the vertical size of the diffusion halo is smaller than 2 kpc – which is in tension with radioactive cosmic ray fluxes and radio data. Furthermore, AMS-02data rule out pure or mixed channels with a component of. The only DM candidate that fits the GCE spectrum and is compatible with constraints obtained with the combined dSphs analysis and the AMS-02anddata annihilates purely into, has a mass of 60 GeV and roughly a thermal cross section.

[2101.11029] Holographic entanglement negativity and replica symmetry breaking	Xi Dong Xiao-Liang Qi and Michael Walter	institutetext:	xidong@ucsb.edu m.walter@uva.nl xlqi@stanford.edu	Since the work of Ryu and Takayanagi, deep connections between quantum entanglement and spacetime geometry have been revealed. The negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of a bipartite density operator is a useful diagnostic of entanglement. In this paper, we discuss the properties of the associatedentanglement negativityand its Rényi generalizations in holographic duality. We first review the definition of the Rényi negativities, which contain the familiar logarithmic negativity as a special case. We then study these quantities in the random tensor network model and rigorously derive their large bond dimension asymptotics. Finally, we study entanglement negativity in holographic theories with a gravity dual, where we find that Rényi negativities are often dominated by bulk solutions that break the replica symmetry. From these replica symmetry breaking solutions, we derive general expressions for Rényi negativities and their special limits including the logarithmic negativity. In fixed-area states, these general expressions simplify dramatically and agree precisely with our results in the random tensor network model. This provides a concrete setting for further studying the implications of replica symmetry breaking in holography.	
[2101.11030] Enabling Dataflow Optimization for Quantum Programs	David Ittah Thomas Häner Vadym Kliuchnikov Torsten Hoefler	ETH	thhaner@microsoft.com htor@inf.ethz.ch david.ittah@mail.mcgill.ca v.kliuchnikov@gmail.com	We propose an IR for quantum computing that directly exposes quantum and classical data dependencies for the purpose of optimization. TheQuantum Intermediate Representation for Optimization(QIRO) consists of two dialects, one input dialect and one that is specifically tailored to enable quantum-classical co-optimization. While the first employs a perhaps more intuitive memory-semantics (quantum operations act as side-effects), the latter uses value-semantics (operations consume and produce states). Crucially, this encodes the dataflow directly in the IR, allowing for a host of optimizations that leverage dataflow analysis. We discuss how to map existing quantum programming languages to the input dialect and how to lower the resulting IR to the optimization dialect. We present a prototype implementation based on MLIR that includes several quantum-specific optimization passes. Our benchmarks show that significant improvements in resource requirements are possible even through static optimization. In contrast to circuit optimization at run time, this is achieved while incurring only a small constant overhead in compilation time, making this a compelling approach for quantum program optimization at application scale.	quantum compilation | dataflow optimization | intermediate representation | MLIR
[2101.11031] Is a Miracle-less WIMP Ruled out?	Jason Arakawa Tim M.P. Tait	Department of Physics and Astronomy University of California Irvine CA 92697-4575 USA		We examine a real electroweak triplet scalar field as dark matter, abandoning the requirement that its relic abundance is determined through freeze out in a standard cosmological history (a situation which we refer to as ‘miracle-less WIMP’). We extract the bounds on such a particle from collider searches, searches for direct scattering with terrestrial targets, and searches for the indirect products of annihilation. Each type of search provides complementary information, and each is most effective in a different region of parameter space. LHC searches tend to be highly dependent on the mass of the SU(2) charged partner state, and are effective for very large or very tiny mass splitting between it and the neutral dark matter component. Direct searches are very effective at bounding the Higgs portal coupling, but ineffective once it falls below. Indirect searches suffer from large astrophysical uncertainties due to the backgrounds and-factors, but do provide key information for100 GeV to TeV masses. Synthesizing the allowed parameter space, this example of WIMP dark matter remains viable, but only in miracle-less regimes.	
[2101.11032] The original Wigner’s friend paradox within a realist toy model	Matteo Lostaglio Joseph Bowles	Korteweg-de Vries Institute for Mathematics and QuSoft University of Amsterdam The Netherlands		The original Wigner’s friend paradox is a gedankenexperiment involving an observer described by an external agent. The paradox highlights the tension between unitary evolution and collapse in quantum theory, and is sometimes taken as requiring a reassessment of the notion of objective reality. In this note however we present a classical toy model in which (i) The contradicting predictions at the heart of the thought experiment are reproduced (ii) Every system is in a well-defined state at all times. The toy model shows how puzzles such as Wigner’s friend’s experience of being in a superposition, conflicts between different agents’ descriptions of the experiment, the positioning of the Heisenberg’s cut and the apparent lack of objectivity of measurement outcomes can be explained within a classical model where there exists an objective state of affairs about every physical system at all times. Within the model, the debate surrounding the original Wigner’s friend thought experiment and its resolution have striking similarities with arguments concerning the nature of the second law of thermodynamics. The same conclusion however does not apply to more recent extensions of the gedankenexperiment featuring multiple encapsulated observers, and shows that such extensions are indeed necessary avoid simple classical explanations.	
[2101.11033] Adding eccentricity to quasicircular binary-black-hole waveform models	Yoshinta Setyawati Frank Ohme	Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) Callinstraße 38 30167 Hannover GermanyLeibniz Universität Hannover 30167 Hannover GermanyInstitute for Gravitational and Subatomic Physics (GRASP) Department of Physics Utrecht University Princetonplein 1 3584 CC Utrecht The Netherlands		The detection of gravitational-wave signals from coalescing eccentric binary black holes would yield unprecedented information about the formation and evolution of compact binaries in specific scenarios, such as dynamical formation in dense stellar clusters and three-body interactions. The gravitational-wave searches by the ground-based interferometers, LIGO and Virgo, rely on analytical waveform models for binaries on quasicircular orbits. Eccentric merger waveform models are less developed, and only few numerical simulations of eccentric mergers are publicly available, but several eccentric inspiral models have been developed from the Post-Newtonian expansion. Here we present a novel method to convert the dominant quadrupolar mode of any circular analytical binary-black-hole model into an eccentric model. First, using numerical simulations, we examine the additional amplitude and frequency modulations of eccentric signals that are not present in their circular counterparts. Subsequently, we identify suitable analytical descriptions of those modulations and interpolate key parameters from twelve numerical simulations designated as our training dataset. This allows us to reconstruct the modulated amplitude and phase of any waveform up to mass ratio 3 and eccentricity 0.2. We find that the minimum overlap of the new model with numerical simulations is around 0.98 over all of our test dataset that are scaled to a 50Mblack-hole binary starting at 35 Hz with aLIGO A+ design sensitivity. A Python packagepyrexeasily carries out the computation of this method.

Despite not being tuned to reproduce the detailed structure of the CMZ, we find that four of these galaxies are consistent with CMZ observations at some point during this 22 Myr period. The galaxies presented here are not homogeneous in their central structures, roughly dividing into two morphological classes; (a) several of the galaxies have very asymmetric gas and SFR distributions, with intense (compact) starbursts occurring over a period of roughly 10 Myr, and structures on highly eccentric orbits through the CMZ, whereas (b) others have smoother gas and SFR distributions, with only slowly varying SFRs over the period analyzed. In class (a) centers, the orbital motion of gas and star-forming complexes across small apertures (pc, analogouslyin the CMZ observations) contributes as much to tracers of star formation/dense gas appearing in those apertures, as the internal evolution of those structures does. These asymmetric/bursty galactic centers can simultaneously match CMZ gasandSFR observations, demonstrating that time-varying star formation can explain the CMZ’s low star formation efficiency.

Pre-finetuning is massively multi-task learning (around 50 datasets, over 4.8 million total labeled examples), and is designed to encourage learning of representations that generalize better to many different tasks. We show that pre-finetuning consistently improves performance for pretrained discriminators (e.g. RoBERTa) and generation models (e.g. BART) on a wide range of tasks (sentence prediction, commonsense reasoning, MRC, etc.), while also significantly improving sample efficiency during fine-tuning. We also show that large-scale multi-tasking is crucial; pre-finetuning can hurt performance when few tasks are used up until a critical point (usually above 15) after which performance improves linearly in the number of tasks.

In this work, we introduce a new algorithmic framework forcomplementary composite minimization, where the objective function decouples into a (weakly) smooth and a uniformly convex term. This particular form of decoupling is pervasive in statistics and machine learning, due to its link to regularization.

ChiStanford  FutrellUniversity of California,  MahowaldUniversity of California, Santa		mahowald@ucsb.edu rfutrell@uci.edu isabelvp@stanford.edu ethanchi@cs.stanford.edu	We investigate how Multilingual BERT (mBERT) encodes grammar by examining how the high-order grammatical feature ofmorphosyntactic alignment(how different languages define what counts as a “subject”) is manifested across the embedding spaces of different languages. To understand if and how morphosyntactic alignment affects contextual embedding spaces, we train classifiers to recover the subjecthood of mBERT embeddings in transitive sentences (which do not contain overt information about morphosyntactic alignment) and then evaluate them zero-shot on intransitive sentences (where subjecthood classification depends on alignment), within and across languages. We find that the resulting classifier distributions reflect the morphosyntactic alignment of their training languages. Our results demonstrate thatmBERT representations are influenced by high-level grammatical features that are not manifested in any one input sentence, and that this is robust across languages. Further examining the characteristics that our classifiers rely on, we find that features such as passive voice, animacy and case strongly correlate with classification decisions, suggesting that mBERT does not encode subjecthood purely syntactically, but that subjecthood embedding is continuous and dependent on semantic and discourse factors, as is proposed in much of the functional linguistics literature. Together, these results provide insight into how grammatical features manifest in contextual embedding spaces, at a level of abstraction not covered by previous work.111We release the code to reproduce our experiments herehttps://github.com/toizzy/deep-subjecthood

We find that the fractional number of BSS compared to RGB stars increases with age, starting near zero at 1 Gyr and flattening toby 4 Gyr. Fitting stellar evolutionary tracks to these BSS, we find that their mass distribution peaks at a few tenths of a solar mass above the main-sequence turnoff. BSS more than 0.5 Mabove the turnoff make up only% of the sample, and BSS more than 1.0 Mabove the turnoff are rare. We compare this to Compact Object Synthesis and Monte Carlo Investigation Code (COSMIC) population synthesis models of BSS formed via mass transfer. We find that standard population synthesis assumptions dramatically under-produce the number of BSS in old open clusters. We also find that these models overproduce high mass BSS relative to lower mass BSS. Expected numbers of BSS formed through dynamics do not fully account for this discrepancy. We conclude that in order to explain the observed BSS populations from Roche lobe oveflow, mass-transfer from giant donors must be more stable than assumed in canonical mass-transfer prescriptions, and including non-conservative mass transfer is important in producing realistic BSS masses. Even with these modifications, it is difficult to achieve the large number of BSS observed in the oldest open clusters. We discuss some additional physics that may explain the large number of observed blue stragglers among old stellar populations.

CUDA and OpenCL developers write scalar code that is implicitly parallelized by compiler and hardware. On Intel GPUs, however, this abstraction has profound performance implications as the underlying ISA is SIMD and important hardware capabilities cannot be fully utilized. To close this performance gap we introduce C-For-Metal (CM), an explicit SIMD programming framework designed to deliver close-to-the-metal performance on Intel GPUs. The CM programming language and its vector/matrix types provide an intuitive interface to exploit the underlying hardware features, allowing fine-grained register management, SIMD size control and cross-lane data sharing. Experimental results show that CM applications from different domains outperform the best-known SIMT-based OpenCL implementations, achieving up to 2.7x speedup on the latest Intel GPU.

To exploit the architectural parallelism offered by the multicore processors, parallel task models, scheduling algorithms and response-time analyses with respect to real-time constraints have to be provided.

We devise design rules and analyses to guarantee bounded tardiness for a specified bounded probability for-consecutive deadline misses without enforcing late jobs to be immediately aborted.

[2101.11054] Remote Learners, Home Makers: How Digital Fabrication Was Taught Online During a Pandemic	Gabrielle Benabdallah Samuelle Bourgault Nadya Peek Jennifer Jacobs	University of Washington		Digital fabrication courses that relied on physical makerspaces were severely disrupted by COVID-19. As universities shut down in Spring 2020, instructors developed new models for digital fabrication at a distance. Through interviews with faculty and students and examination of course materials, we recount the experiences of eight remote digital fabrication courses. We found that learning with hobbyist equipment and online social networks could emulate using industrial equipment in shared workshops. Furthermore, at-home digital fabrication offered unique learning opportunities including more iteration, machine tuning, and maintenance. These opportunities depended on new forms of labor and varied based on student living situations. Our findings have implications for remote and in-person digital fabrication instruction. They indicate how access to tools was important, but not as critical as providing opportunities for iteration; they show how remote fabrication exacerbated student inequities; and they suggest strategies for evaluating trade-offs in remote fabrication models with respect to learning objectives.

The local views are constructed using the global eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian and are registered using Procrustes analysis. The choice of these eigenvectors may vary across the regions. In contrast to existing techniques,LDLE can embed closed and non-orientable manifolds into their intrinsic dimension by tearing them apart. It also provides gluing instruction on the boundary of the torn embedding to help identify the topology of the original manifold. Our experimental results will show that LDLE largely preserved distances up to a constant scale while other techniques produced higher distortion. We also demonstrate that LDLE produces high quality embeddings even when the data is noisy or sparse.

Percus Kristina Lerman	Sciences Institute University of Southern California Marina del Rey USA 90292	keithab@isi.edu	Research collaborations provide the foundation for scientific advances, but we have only recently begun to understand how they form and grow on a global scale. Here we analyze a model of the growth of research collaboration networks to explain the empirical observations that the number of collaborations scales superlinearly with institution size, though at different rates (heterogeneous densification), the number of institutions grows as a power of the number of researchers (Heaps’ law) and institution sizes approximate Zipf’s law. This model has three mechanisms: (i) researchers are preferentially hired by large institutions, (ii) new institutions trigger more potential institutions, and (iii) researchers collaborate with friends-of-friends. We show agreement between these assumptions and empirical data, through analysis of co-authorship networks spanning two centuries. We then develop a theoretical understanding of this model, which reveals emergent heterogeneous scaling such that the number of collaborations between institutions scale with an institution’s size.

This information is present both in the domain and the class labels. In this work we investigate the complementary roles of these two sources of information by combining instance-discriminative contrastive learning and supervised learning in a single framework calledSupervisedMomentumContrastive learning (SupMoCo). Our approach avoids a problem observed in supervised learning where information in images not relevant to the task is discarded, which hampers their generalization to novel tasks. We show that (self-supervised) contrastive learning and supervised learning are mutually beneficial, leading to a new state-of-the-art on theMeta-Dataset[47]— a recently introduced benchmark for few-shot learning. Our method is based on a simple modification ofMoCo[19]and scales better than prior work on combining supervised and self-supervised learning. This allows us to easily combine data from multiple domains leading to further improvements.

Our model uses a combination of sparse and dense document representations, aggregates document-cluster similarity along these multiple representations and makes the clustering decision using a neural classifier. The weighted document-cluster similarity model is learned using a novel adaptation of the triplet loss into a linear classification objective. We show that the use of a suitable fine-tuning objective and external knowledge in pre-trained transformer models yields significant improvements in the effectiveness of contextual embeddings for clustering. Our model achieves a new state-of-the-art on a standard stream clustering dataset of English documents.	
[2101.11060] Defenses Against Multi-Sticker Physical Domain Attacks on Classifiers	Xinwei Zhao Matthew C. Stamm	institutetext:	mstamm@drexel.edu xz355@drexel.edu	Recently, physical domain adversarial attacks have drawn significant attention from the machine learning community. One important attack proposed by Eykholt et al. can fool a classifier by placing black and white stickers on an object such as a road sign. While this attack may pose a significant threat to visual classifiers, there are currently no defenses designed to protect against this attack. In this paper, we propose new defenses that can protect against multi-sticker attacks. We present defensive strategies capable of operating when the defender has full, partial, and no prior information about the attack. By conducting extensive experiments, we show that our proposed defenses can outperform existing defenses against physical attacks when presented with a multi-sticker attack.

We show that a simple picture of an effective local tilt describes a variety of cases. Our examples include spinless fermions (as modeled by Heisenberg spin chain in a magnetic field), spinful fermions as well as bosons that enjoy a larger local on-site Hilbert space. We also discuss the domain-wall dynamics that reveals nonergodic features even for a relatively weak tilt as suggested by Doggen et. al. [arXiv:2012.13722]. By adding a harmonic potential on top of the static field we confirm that the surprizing regular dynamics is not entirely due to Hilbert space shuttering. It seems better explained by the inhibited transport within the domains of identically oriented spins. Once the spin-1/2 restrictions are lifted as, e.g., for bosons, the dynamics involve stronger entanglement generation. Again for domain wall melting, the effect of the harmonic potential is shown to lead mainly to an effective local tilt.

[2101.11065] Inhomogeneous mean-field approach to collective excitations near the superfluid-Mott glass transition	Martin Puschmann João C. Getelina José A. Hoyos Thomas Vojta	journal:		We develop an inhomogeneous quantum mean-field approach to the behavior of collective excitations across the superfluid-Mott glass quantum phase transition in two dimensions, complementing recent quantum Monte Carlo simulations [Phys. Rev. Lett.125, 027002 (2020)]. In quadratic (Gaussian) approximation, the Goldstone (phase) and Higgs (amplitude) modes completely decouple. Each is described by a disordered Bogoliubov Hamiltonian which can be solved by an inhomogeneous multi-mode Bogoliubov transformation. We find that the Higgs mode is spatially localized in both phases. The corresponding scalar spectral function shows a broad peak that is noncritical in the sense that its peak frequency does not soften but remains nonzero across the quantum phase transition. In contrast, the lowest-energy Goldstone mode delocalizes in the superfluid phase, leading to a zero-frequency spectral peak. We compare these findings to the results of the quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We also relate them to general results on the localization of bosonic excitations, and we discuss the limits and generality of our approach.	quantum phase transition | disorder | collective excitation | superfluid | localization

[2101.11068] The Galactic Chemical Evolution of Chlorine	Z. G. Maas C. A. Pilachowski	University of Texas at Austin McDonald Observatory Austin TX 78712 USA	zgmaas@utexas.edu	We measuredCl abundances in 52 M giants with metallicities between –0.5[Fe/H]0.12. Abundances and atmospheric parameters were derived using infrared spectra from CSHELL on the IRTF and from optical echelle spectra. We measured Cl abundances by fitting a HCl molecular feature at 3.6985m with synthetic spectra. We also measured the abundances of O, Ca, Ti, and Fe using atomic absorption lines. We find that the [Cl/Fe] ratio for our stars agrees with chemical evolution models of Cl and the [Cl/Ca] ratio is broadly consistent with the solar ratio over our metallicity range. Both indicate that Cl is primarily made in core-collapse supernovae with some contributions from Type Ia SN. We suggest other potential nucleosynthesis processes, such as the-process, are not significant producers of Cl. Finally, we also find our Cl abundances are consistent with H II and planetary nebular abundances at a given oxygen abundance, although there is scatter in the data.

[2101.11069] The Neupert Effect of Flare UltraViolet and Soft X-ray Emissions	Jiong Qiu	Department of Physics Montana State University Bozeman MT USA		We model the Neupert effect that relates flare heating energy with the observed SXR emission. The traditional form of the Neupert effect refers to the correlation between the time-integrated HXR or microwave light curve and the SXR light curve. In this paper, instead, we use as the proxy for heating energy the ultraviolet (UV) emission at the foot-points of flare loops, and modify the model of the Neupert effect by taking into account the discrete nature of flare heating as well as cooling. In the modified empirical model, spatially resolved UV lightcurves from the transition region or upper chromosphere are each convolved with a kernel function characterizing decay of the flare loop emission. Contributions by all loops are summed to compare with the observed total SXR emission. The model has successfully reproduced the observed SXR emission from its rise to decay. To estimate heating energies in flare loops, we also employ the UV Foot-point Calorimeter (UFC) method that infers heating rates in flare loops from these UV light curves and models evolution of flare loops with a zero-dimensional hydrodynamic code. The experiments show that a multitude of impulsive heating events do not well reproduce the observed flare SXR light curve, but a two-phase heating model leads to better agreement with observations. Comparison of the two models of the Neupert effect further allows us to calibrate the UFC method, and improve the estimate of heating rates in flare loops continuously formed by magnetic reconnection throughout the flare evolution.

We conjecture that a good candidate subteam should have high skill and structural similarity with the replaced subteam while sharing a similar connection with the larger team as a whole. Based on this conjecture, we propose a novel graph kernel which evaluates the goodness of candidate subteams in this holistic way freely adjustable to the need of the situation. To tackle the significant computational difficulties, we equip our kernel with a fast approximation algorithm which (a) employs effective pruning strategies, (b) exploits the similarity between candidate team structures to reduce kernel computations, and (c) features a solid theoretical bound on the quality of the obtained solution. We extensively test our solution on both synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. Our proposed graph kernel outputs more human-agreeable recommendations compared to metrics used in previous work, and our algorithm consistently outperforms alternative choices by finding near-optimal solutions while scaling linearly with the size of the replaced subteam.

As state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) systems require an ever-increasing number of samples, their development is restricted to a continually shrinking segment of the AI community. Likewise, many of these systems cannot be applied to real-world problems, where environment samples are expensive. Resolution of these limitations requires new, sample-efficient methods.

[2101.11072] Index matching computerized tomography	Vincent Daley Owen Paetkau Mark Paetkau	Physical Sciences Department Thompson Rivers University		Computerized tomography (CT) has been used for decades by medical professionals to detect and diagnose injuries and ailments. CT scanners are based on interesting physics, but due to their bulk, cost, and safety, hands on experience with a medical CT scanner is unrealistic for undergraduate students. Therefore, operationally similar, yet small, safe, and inexpensive CT scanners are desirable teaching tools. This project details the development of a novel model CT scanning apparatus. The experimental setup presented utilizes visible light, has short data acquisition time, and operates on the same physics as its X-ray counterpart. The apparatus employs a laser and photodiode to image a transparent material, while avoiding loss of transmitted intensity through index of refraction matching. A simple back-projection algorithm results in a 2D cross section of the scan object. We found we could collect data and reliably image samples in 15 minutes.

Property inference attacks consider an adversary who has access to the trained model and tries to extract some global statistics of the training data. In this work, we study property inference in scenarios where the adversary can maliciously control part of the training data (poisoning data) with the goal of increasing the leakage.	
[2101.11074] Patient Diversion Across Primary Health Centers Using Real Time Delay Predictors	Najiya Fatma, Varun RamamohanDepartment of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi			In the current work, we consider diversion of childbirth patients who arrive seeking emergency admission to public primary health centers (PHCs). PHCs are the first point of contact for an Indian patient with formal medical care, and offer medical care on an outpatient basis, and limited inpatient and childbirth care. In this context, real-time prediction of the wait time of the arriving patient becomes important in order to determine whether the patient must be diverted to another PHC or not. We study this problem using a discrete event simulation that we develop of medical care operations in two PHCs in India. We approximate the labour room service at each PHC as an M/G/1 queueing system and show how the accuracy of real-time delay predictors impacts the extent of the change in operational outcomes at each PHC. We simulate patient diversion using actual delays as well as the delay estimates generated by various delay predictors based on the state of the system such as queue-length, elapsed service time, and observed delay histories. The simulation of the diversion process also incorporates travel time between the PHCs. We also propose a new delay predictor that incorporates information regarding the system state as well as the service time distribution. We compare the operational outcomes at both PHCs without diversion and with diversion using the above delay predictors. We show numerically that more accurate delay predictors lead to more equitable distribution of resources involved in provision of childbirth care across both PHCs.

The rotation angles are given by composite pulse control which is the well-known quantum control technique. A big advantage of this method can analytically calculate the rotation angles and can be easily extended to the multiple layers. The more layers of the metamaterials can present more bandwidth of half-wave plate. In this paper, we present 1, 3, 5, 7 configurations of layers of a metamaterial half-wave plate and we demonstrate that our device increasingly enhance the bandwidth of performance.	pacs:42.82.Et | 42.81.Qb | 42.79.Gn | 32.80.Xx

In so doing, we consider anonfluctuatingtarget embedded in complex white Gaussian noise (CWGN), in which the amplitude of the target echo and the noise power are assumed to be unknown. Important works have analyzed the performance for the referred scenario and proposed GLRT-based detectors. Such detectors are projected at an early stage (i.e., prior to the formation of a post-beamforming scalar waveform), thereby imposing high demands on hardware, processing, and data storage. From a hardware perspective, most radar systems fail to meet these strong requirements. In fact, due to hardware and computational constraints, most radars use a combination of analog and digital beamformers (sums) before any estimation or further pre-processing. The rationale behind this study is to derive a GLRT detector that meets the hardware and system requirements. In this work, we design and analyze a more practical and easy-to-implement GLRT detector, which is projected after the analog beamforming. The performance of the proposed detector is analyzed and the probabilities of detection (PD) and false alarm (PFA) are derived inclosed form. An alternative fast converging series for the PD is also derived. This series proves to be very efficient and computationally tractable, saving both computation time and computational load. Moreover, we show that in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, the post-beamforming GLRT detector performs better than both the classic pre-beamforming GLRT detector and the square-law detector. This finding suggests that if the signals are weak, instead of processing the signals separately, we first must to reinforce the overall signal and then assembling the system’sdetection statistic. We also showed that the PFA of the post-beamforming GLRT detector is independent of the number of antennas. This property allows us to improve the PD (by increasing the number of antennas) while maintaining a fixed PFA. At last, the SNR losses are quantified, in which the superiority of the post-beamforming GLRT detector was evidenced as the number of antennas and samples increase.

Ertin are with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering The Ohio State University Columbus OH 43210 USA. Contact e-mail:	civek.1@osu.edu	In this paper, we investigate the problem of inverse electromagnetic scattering to recover multilayer human tissue profiles using ultrawideband radar systems in Bayesian setting. We study the recovery problem in blind setting, in which we simultaneously estimate both the dielectric/geometric properties of the one-dimensional target tissue profile and the transmitted radar waveform. To perform Bayesian parameter estimation, we propose a hybrid and adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, which combines the Slice sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approaches. The introduced sampling mechanism also incorporates the Parallel Tempering approach to escape from the local optimal regions of the complex posterior distribution. We provide empirical support through various numerical simulations for the achieved enhanced sampling efficiency compared to conventional sampling schemes. To investigate the recovery performance, we work on synthetic measurements simulating actual radar returns from multilayer tissue profiles. We derive theoretical bounds for the best achievable estimation performance in terms of normalized root mean square error and provide a comparison with the performance of our estimator.

[2101.11080] Deep Video Inpainting Detection	Peng Zhou1 Ning Yu1 Zuxuan Wu1 Larry S. Davis1 Abhinav Shrivastava1and Ser-Nam Lim2	1University of Maryland College Park2Facebook AI		This paper studies video inpainting detection, which localizes an inpainted region in a video both spatially and temporally. In particular, we introduce VIDNet, Video Inpainting Detection Network, which contains a two-stream encoder-decoder architecture with attention module. To reveal artifacts encoded in compression, VIDNet additionally takes in Error Level Analysis frames to augment RGB frames, producing multimodal features at different levels with an encoder. Exploring spatial and temporal relationships, these features are further decoded by a Convolutional LSTM to predict masks of inpainted regions. In addition, when detecting whether a pixel is inpainted or not, we present a quad-directional local attention module that borrows information from its surrounding pixels from four directions. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our approach. We demonstrate, among other things, that VIDNet not only outperforms by clear margins alternative inpainting detection methods but also generalizes well on novel videos that are unseen during training.	
[2101.11081] The Effect of Class Definitions on the Transferability of Adversarial Attacks Against Forensic CNNs	Xinwei Zhao and Matthew C. Stamm; Drexel University; Philadelphia, PA,		mstamm@coe.drexel.edu xz355@drexel.edu	In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used by researchers to perform forensic tasks such as image tampering detection. At the same time, adversarial attacks have been developed that are capable of fooling CNN-based classifiers. Understanding the transferability of adversarial attacks, i.e. an attack’s ability to attack a different CNN than the one it was trained against, has important implications for designing CNNs that are resistant to attacks. While attacks on object recognition CNNs are believed to be transferrable, recent work by Barni et al. has shown that attacks on forensic CNNs have difficulty transferring to other CNN architectures or CNNs trained using different datasets. In this paper, we demonstrate that adversarial attacks on forensic CNNs are even less transferrable than previously thought – even between virtually identical CNN architectures! We show that several common adversarial attacks against CNNs trained to identify image manipulation fail to transfer to CNNs whose only difference is in the class definitions (i.e. the same CNN architectures trained using the same data). We note that all formulations of class definitions contain the “unaltered” class. This has important implications for the future design of forensic CNNs that are robust to adversarial and anti-forensic attacks.	
[2101.11082] Error-correcting entanglement swapping using a practical logical photon encoding	Paul Hilaire Edwin Barnes Sophia E. Economou Frédéric Grosshans	Department of Physics Virginia Tech Blacksburg Virginia 24061 USA		Several emerging quantum technologies, including quantum networks, modular and fusion-based quantum computing, rely crucially on the ability to perform photonic Bell state measurements. Therefore, photon losses and the 50% success probablity upper bound of Bell state measurements pose a critical limitation to photonic quantum technologies. Here, we develop protocols that overcome these two key challenges through logical encoding of photonic qubits. Our approach uses a tree graph state logical encoding, which can be produced deterministically with a few quantum emitters, and achieves near-deterministic logical photonic Bell state measurements while also protecting against errors including photon losses, with a record loss-tolerance threshold.	
[2101.11083] Unsupervised tree boosting for learning probability distributions	Naoki Awaya and Li MaDepartment of Statistical ScienceDuke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA			We propose an unsupervised tree boosting algorithm for inferring the underlying sampling distribution of an i.i.d. sample based on fitting additive tree ensembles in a fashion analogous to supervised tree boosting. Integral to the algorithm is a new notion of “addition” on probability distributions that leads to a coherent notion of “residualization”, i.e., subtracting a probability distribution from an observation to remove the distributional structure from the sampling distribution of the latter. We show that these notions arise naturally for univariate distributions through cumulative distribution function (CDF) transforms and compositions due to several “group-like” properties of univariate CDFs. While the traditional multivariate CDF does not preserve these properties, a new definition of multivariate CDF can restore these properties, thereby allowing the notions of “addition” and “residualization” to be formulated for multivariate settings as well. This then gives rise to the unsupervised boosting algorithm based on forward-stagewise fitting of an additive tree ensemble, which sequentially reduces the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the truth. The algorithm allows analytic evaluation of the fitted density and outputs a generative model that can be readily sampled from. We enhance the algorithm with scale-dependent shrinkage and a two-stage strategy that separately fits the marginals and the copula. The algorithm then performs competitively to state-of-the-art deep-learning approaches in multivariate density estimation on multiple benchmark datasets.

[2101.11085] EPIC-Survival: End-to-end Part Inferred Clustering for Survival Analysis, Featuring Prognostic Stratification Boosting	Hassan Muhammad Chensu Xie Carlie S. Sigel Amber Simpson Michael Doukas Lindsay Alpert William R. Jarnagin Thomas J. Fuchs	Department of Physiology Biophysics and Systems Biology - Weill Cornell Medicine		Histopathology-based survival modelling has two major hurdles. Firstly, a well-performing survival model has minimal clinical application if it does not contribute to the stratification of a cancer patient cohort into different risk groups, preferably driven by histologic morphologies. In the clinical setting, individuals are not given specific prognostic predictions, but are rather predicted to lie within a risk group which has a general survival trend. Thus, It is imperative that a survival model produces well-stratified risk groups. Secondly, until now, survival modelling was done in a two-stage approach (encoding and aggregation). The massive amount of pixels in digitized whole slide images were never utilized to their fullest extent due to technological constraints on data processing, forcing decoupled learning. EPIC-Survival bridges encoding and aggregation into an end-to-end survival modelling approach, while introducing stratification boosting to encourage the model to not only optimize ranking, but also to discriminate between risk groups. In this study we show that EPIC-Survival performs better than other approaches in modelling intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a historically difficult cancer to model. Further, we show that stratification boosting improves further improves model performance, resulting in a concordance-index of 0.880 on a held-out test set. Finally, we were able to identify specific histologic differences, not commonly sought out in ICC, between low and high risk groups.	
[2101.11086] A general method for power analysis in testing high dimensional covariance matrices	Qiyang Han Tiefeng Jiang Yandi Shen	Department of Statistics Rutgers University Piscataway NJ 08854 	jiang040@umn.edu ydshen@uw.edu qh85@stat.rutgers.edu	Covariance matrix testing for high dimensional data is a fundamental problem. A large class of covariance test statistics based on certain averaged spectral statistics of the sample covariance matrix are known to obey central limit theorems under the null. However, precise understanding for the power behavior of the corresponding tests under general alternatives remains largely unknown. This paper develops a general method for analyzing the power behavior of covariance test statistics via accurate non-asymptotic power expansions. We specialize our general method to two prototypical settings of testing identity and sphericity, and derive sharp power expansion for a number of widely used tests, including the likelihood ratio tests, Ledoit-Nagao-Wolf’s test, Cai-Ma’s test and John’s test. The power expansion for each of those tests holds uniformly over all possible alternatives under mild growth conditions on the dimension-to-sample ratio. Interestingly, although some of those tests are previously known to share the same limiting power behavior under spiked covariance alternatives with a fixed number of spikes, our new power characterizations indicate that such equivalence fails when many spikes exist. The proofs of our results combine techniques from Poincaré-type inequalities, random matrices and zonal polynomials.

[2101.11087] The membership problem for constant-sized quantum correlations is undecidable	Honghao Fu Carl A. Miller William Slofstra	Institute for Quantum Information and Computer Science University of Maryland College Park MD 20740 USA	camiller@umd.edu weslofst@uwaterloo.ca h7fu@umd.edu	When two spatially separated parties make measurements on an unknown entangled quantum state, what correlations can they achieve? How difficult is it to determine whether a given correlation is a quantum correlation? These questions are central to problems in quantum communication and computation. Previous work has shown that the general membership problem for quantum correlations is computationally undecidable. In the current work we show something stronger: there is a family of constant-sized correlations — that is, correlations for which the number of measurements and number of measurement outcomes are fixed — such that solving the quantum membership problem for this family is computationally impossible. Thus, the undecidability that arises in understanding Bell experiments is not dependent on varying the number of measurements in the experiment. This places strong constraints on the types of descriptions that can be given for quantum correlation sets. Our proof is based on a combination of techniques from quantum self-testing and undecidability results for linear system nonlocal games.

G. Road, Kolkata 700009, India		atrideb@ncra.tifr.res.inE tirth@ncra.tifr.res.in	We present a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based parameter estimation package,CosmoReionMC, to jointly constrain cosmological parameters of theCDM model and the astrophysical parameters related to hydrogen reionization. The package is based on a previously developed physically motivated semi-analytical model for reionization, a similar semi-analytical model for computing the global 21 cm signal during the cosmic dawn and using an appropriately modified version of the publicly available CAMB for computing the CMB anisotropies. These calculations are then coupled to an MCMC ensemble sampleremceeto compute the posterior distributions of the model parameter. The model has twelve free parameters in total: five cosmological and seven related to the stellar populations. We constrain the parameters by matching the theoretical predictions with CMB data from Planck, observations related to the quasar absorption spectra and, for the first time, the global 21 cm signal from EDGES. We find that incorporating the quasar spectra data in the analysis tightens the bounds on the electron scattering optical depthand consequently the normalizationof the primordial matter power spectrum (or equivalently). Furthermore, when we include the EDGES data in the analysis, we find that an early population of metal-free stars with efficient radio emission is necessary to match the absorption amplitude. TheCosmoReionMCpackage should have interesting future applications, e.g., probing non-standard extensions to theCDM model.	intergalactic medium – dark ages | reionization | first stars – stars: Population III – cosmology: theory.

Rosalina Maria dos Santos 1233Campo MourãoBrazil	Jesse.Egbert@nau.edu Eck.Doerry@nau.edu Marco.Gerosa@nau.edu anachaves@utfpr.edu.br Toby.Hocking@nau.edu	Chatbots are often designed to mimic social roles attributed to humans. However, little is known about the impact on user’s perceptions of using language that fails to conform to the associated social role. Our research draws on sociolinguistic theory to investigate how a chatbot’s language choices can adhere to the expected social role the agent performs within a given context. In doing so, we seek to understand whether chatbots design should account for linguistic register. This research analyzes how register differences play a role in shaping the user’s perception of the human-chatbot interaction. Ultimately, we want to determine whether register-specific language influences users’ perceptions and experiences with chatbots. We produced parallel corpora of conversations in the tourism domain with similar content and varying register characteristics and evaluated users’ preferences of chatbot’s linguistic choices in terms of appropriateness, credibility, and user experience. Our results show that register characteristics are strong predictors of user’s preferences, which points to the needs of designing chatbots with register-appropriate language to improve acceptance and users’ perceptions of chatbot interactions.	chatbots | conversational agents | language design | register | user perceptions

[2101.11091] Nonconvex Regularized Gradient Projection Sparse Reconstruction for Massive MIMO Channel Estimation	Pengxia Wu and Julian Cheng		pengxia.wu@alumni.ubc.ca julian.cheng@ubc.ca	Novel sparse reconstruction algorithms are proposed for beamspace channel estimation in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. The proposed algorithms minimize a least-squares objective having a nonconvex regularizer. This regularizer removes the penalties on a fewlarge-magnitudeelements from the conventional-normregularizer, and thus it only forces penalties on the remaining elements that are expected to be zeros. Accurate and fast reconstructions can be achieved by performing gradient projection updates within the framework of difference of convex functions (DC) programming. A double-loop algorithm and a single-loop algorithm are proposed via different DC decompositions, and these two algorithms have distinct computational complexities and convergence rates. An extension algorithm is further proposed by designing new step sizes for the single-loop algorithm. The extension algorithm has a faster convergence rate and can achieve approximately the same level of accuracy as the proposed double-loop algorithm. Numerical results show signiﬁcant advantages of the proposed algorithms over existing reconstruction algorithms in terms of reconstruction accuracies and runtimes. Compared with the benchmark channel estimation approaches, the proposed algorithms can achieve smaller channel reconstruction error and higher achievable spectral efficiency.

[2101.11092] An Improved Analysis of LP-based Control for Revenue Management	Guanting Chen Xiaocheng Li Yinyu Ye			In this paper, we study a class of revenue management problems where the decision maker aims to maximize the total revenue subject to budget constraints on multiple type of resources over a finite horizon. At each time, a new order/customer/bid is revealed with a request of some resource(s) and a reward, and the decision maker needs to either accept or reject the order. Upon the acceptance of the order, the resource request must be satisfied and the associated revenue (reward) can be collected. We consider a stochastic setting where all the orders are i.i.d. sampled, i.e., the reward-request pair at each time is drawn from an unknown distribution with finite support. The formulation contains many classic applications such as the quantity-based network revenue management problem and the Adwords problem. We focus on the classic LP-based adaptive algorithm and considerregretas the performance measure defined by the gap between the optimal objective value of the certainty-equivalent linear program (LP) and the expected revenue obtained by the online algorithm. Our contribution is two-fold: (i) when the underlying LP is nondegenerate, the algorithm achieves a problem-dependent regret upper bound that is independent of the horizon/number of time periods; (ii) when the underlying LP is degenerate, the algorithm achieves a regret upper bound that scales on the order of. To our knowledge, both results are new and improve the best existing bounds for the LP-based adaptive algorithm in the corresponding setting. We conclude with numerical experiments to further demonstrate our findings.

Optimizing the trade-off between information gain and energy cost (e.g., control effort, distance travelled) is desirable but leads to a non-monotone objective function in the set of robot trajectories. Therefore, common multi-robot planning algorithms based on techniques such as coordinate descent lose their performance guarantees. Methods based on local search provide performance guarantees for optimizing a non-monotone submodular function, but require access to all robots’ trajectories, making it not suitable for distributed execution. This work proposes a distributed planning approach based on local search and shows how lazy/greedy methods can be adopted to reduce the computation and communication of the approach. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method by coordinating robot teams composed of both ground and aerial vehicles with different sensing/control profiles and evaluate the algorithm’s performance in two target tracking scenarios. Compared to the naive distributed execution of local search, our approach saves up to 60% communication and 80–92% computation on average when coordinating up to 10 robots, while outperforming the coordinate descent based algorithm in achieving a desirable trade-off between sensing and energy cost.

The strategy of including Coulomb interaction into the quantization condition of trapped system is discussed in a general and non-perturbative manner. In most cases, Coulomb corrections to quantization condition largely rely on numerical approach or perturbation expansion. Only for some special cases, such as the spherical hard wall trap, a closed-form of quantization condition with all orders of Coulomb corrections can be obtained.	
[2101.11098] A possible mass distribution of primordial black holes implied by LIGO-Virgo	Heling Deng	Department Arizona State University Tempe AZ 85287 USA	heling.deng@asu.edu	The LIGO-Virgo Collaboration has so far detected around 90 black holes, some of which have masses larger than what were expected from the collapse of stars. The mass distribution of LIGO-Virgo black holes appears to have a peak atand two tails on the ends. By assuming that they all have a primordial origin, we analyze the GWTC-1 (O1&O2) and GWTC-2 (O3a) datasets by performing maximum likelihood estimation on a broken power law mass function, with the resultforandfor. This appears to behave better than the popular log-normal mass function. Surprisingly, such a simple and unique distribution can be realized in our previously proposed mechanism of PBH formation, where the black holes are formed by vacuum bubbles that nucleate during inflation via quantum tunneling. Moreover, this mass distribution can also provide an explanation to supermassive black holes formed at high redshifts.	
[2101.11099] Neural networks in quantum many-body physics: a hands-on tutorial	Juan Carrasquilla Giacomo Torlai	thanks:	gttorlai@amazon.com	Over the past years, machine learning has emerged as a powerful computational tool to tackle complex problems over a broad range of scientific disciplines. In particular, artificial neural networks have been successfully deployed to mitigate the exponential complexity often encountered in quantum many-body physics, the study of properties of quantum systems built out of a large number of interacting particles. In this Article, we overview some applications of machine learning in condensed matter physics and quantum information, with particular emphasis on hands-on tutorials serving as a quick-start for a newcomer to the field. We present supervised machine learning with convolutional neural networks to learn a phase transition, unsupervised learning with restricted Boltzmann machines to perform quantum tomography, and variational Monte Carlo with recurrent neural-networks for approximating the ground state of a many-body Hamiltonian. We briefly review the key ingredients of each algorithm and their corresponding neural-network implementation, and show numerical experiments for a system of interacting Rydberg atoms in two dimensions.

Myers	Mellon UniversityPittsburghPA	lpopowski@g.hmc.edu tom.mitchell@cs.cmu.edu bam@cs.cmu.edu tobyli@cs.cmu.edu	Representing the semantics of GUI screens and components is crucial to data-driven computational methods for modeling user-GUI interactions and mining GUI designs. Existing GUI semantic representations are limited to encoding either the textual content, the visual design and layout patterns, or the app contexts. Many representation techniques also require significant manual data annotation efforts. This paper presentsScreen2Vec, a new self-supervised technique for generating representations in embedding vectors of GUI screens and components that encode all of the above GUI features without requiring manual annotation using the context of user interaction traces.Screen2Vecis inspired by the word embedding methodWord2Vec, but uses a new two-layer pipeline informed by the structure of GUIs and interaction traces and incorporates screen- and app-specific metadata. Through several sample downstream tasks, we demonstrateScreen2Vec’s key useful properties: representing between-screen similarity through nearest neighbors, composability, and capability to represent user tasks.

[2101.11107] Central moments multiple relaxation time LBM for hemodynamic simulations in intracranial aneurysms: An in-vitro validation study using PIV and PC-MRI	Seyed Ali Hosseini Philipp Berg Feng Huang Christoph Roloff Gábor Janiga Dominique Thévenin		seyed.hosseini@ovgu.de	The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative to classical Navier-Stokes solvers. This is particularly true for hemodynamics in complex geometries. However, in its most basic formulation, i.e. with the so-called single relaxation time (SRT) collision operator, it has been observed to have a limited stability domain in the Courant/Fourier space, strongly constraining the minimum time-step and grid size. The development of improved collision models such as the multiple relaxation time (MRT) operator in central moments space has tremendously widened the stability domain, while allowing to overcome a number of other well-documented artifacts, therefore opening the door for simulations over a wider range of grid and time-step sizes. The present work focuses on implementing and validating a specific collision operator, the central Hermite moments multiple relaxation time model with the full expansion of the equilibrium distribution function, to simulate blood flows in intracranial aneurysms. The study further proceeds with a validation of the numerical model through different test-cases and against experimental measurements obtained via stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) and phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI). For a patient-specific aneurysm both PIV and PC-MRI agree fairly well with the simulation. Finally, low-resolution simulations were shown to be able to capture blood flow information with sufficient accuracy, as demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the flow field while leading to strongly reduced computation times. For instance in the case of the patient-specific configuration, increasing the grid-size by a factor of two led to a reduction of computation time by a factor of 14 with very good similarity indices still ranging from 0.83 to 0.88.

[2101.11109] First Align, then Predict: Understanding the Cross-Lingual Ability of Multilingual BERT	Benjamin MullerYanai ElazarBenoît SagotDjamé SeddahInria, Paris, FranceSorbonne Université, Paris, FranceComputer Science Department, Bar Ilan UniversityAllen Institute for Artificial Intelligence{benjamin.muller,		yanaiela@gmail.com	Multilingual pretrained language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capabilities. Such transfer emerges by fine-tuning on a task of interest in one language and evaluating on a distinct language, not seen during the fine-tuning. Despite promising results, we still lack a proper understanding of the source of this transfer. Using a novel layer ablation technique and analyses of the model’s internal representations, we show that multilingual BERT, a popular multilingual language model, can be viewed as the stacking of two sub-networks: a multilingual encoder followed by a task-specific language-agnostic predictor. While the encoder is crucial for cross-lingual transfer and remains mostly unchanged during fine-tuning, the task predictor has little importance on the transfer and can be reinitialized during fine-tuning. We present extensive experiments with three distinct tasks, seventeen typologically diverse languages and multiple domains to support our hypothesis.	
[2101.11110] Autonomous Off-road Navigation over Extreme Terrains with Perceptually-challenging Conditions	Rohan Thakker Nikhilesh Alatur David D. Fan Jesus Tordesillas Michael Paton Kyohei Otsu Olivier Toupet and Ali-akbar Agha-mohammadi	institutetext:	firstname.lastname@jpl.nasa.gov alaturn@ethz.ch jtorde@mit.edu	We propose a framework for resilient autonomous navigation in perceptually challenging unknown environments with mobility-stressing elements such as uneven surfaces with rocks and boulders, steep slopes, negative obstacles like cliffs and holes, and narrow passages. Environments are GPS-denied and perceptually-degraded with variable lighting from dark to lit and obscurants (dust, fog, smoke). Lack of prior maps and degraded communication eliminates the possibility of prior or off-board computation or operator intervention. This necessitates real-time on-board computation using noisy sensor data. To address these challenges, we propose a resilient architecture that exploits redundancy and heterogeneity in sensing modalities. Further resilience is achieved by triggering recovery behaviors upon failure. We propose a fast settling algorithm to generate robust multi-fidelity traversability estimates in real-time. The proposed approach was deployed on multiple physical systems including skid-steer and tracked robots, a high-speed RC car and legged robots, as a part of Team CoSTAR’s effort to the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, where the team won 2ndand 1stplace in the Tunnel and Urban Circuits, respectively.

Given an input video along with its subtitles, our approach first extracts informative keyframes by analyzing the subtitles, and stylizes keyframes into comic-style images. Then, we propose a novel automatic multi-page layout framework, which can allocate the images across multiple pages and synthesize visually interesting layouts based on the rich semantics of the images (e.g., importance and inter-image relation). Finally, as opposed to using the same type of balloon as in previous works, we propose an emotion-aware balloon generation method to create different types of word balloons by analyzing the emotion of subtitles and audios. Our method is able to vary balloon shapes and word sizes in balloons in response to different emotions, leading to more enriched reading experience. Once the balloons are generated, they are placed adjacent to their corresponding speakers via speaker detection. Our results show that our method, without requiring any user inputs, can generate high-quality comic pages with visually rich layouts and balloons. Our user studies also demonstrate that users prefer our generated results over those by state-of-the-art comic generation systems.	automatic | comic books | keyframes | stylizing | multi-page | layout
[2101.11112] Cross-Lingual Named Entity Recognition Using Parallel Corpus: A New Approach Using XLM-RoBERTa Alignment	Bing		libi@microsoft.com yujh@microsoft.com wenjinxu@microsoft.com	We propose a novel approach for cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) zero-shot transfer using parallel corpora. We built an entity alignment model on top of XLM-RoBERTa to project theentitiesdetected on the English part of the parallel data to the target language sentences, whose accuracy surpasses all previous unsupervised models. With the alignment model we can get pseudo-labeled NER data set in the target language to train task-specific model. Unlike using translation methods, this approach benefits from natural fluency and nuances in target-language original corpus. We also propose a modified loss function similar to focal loss but assigns weights in the opposite direction to further improve the model training on noisy pseudo-labeled data set. We evaluated this proposed approach over 4 target languages on benchmark data sets and got competitive F1 scores compared to most recent SOTA models. We also gave extra discussions about the impact of parallel corpus size and domain on the final transfer performance.

David Sehloff and Line Roald	thanks:	roald@wisc.edu dsehloff@wisc.edu	Advantages of operating portions of a power system at frequencies different from the standard 50 or 60 Hz have been demonstrated in the low frequency AC (LFAC) and high voltage DC (HVDC) literature. Branches constrained by stability or thermal limits can benefit from increased capacity and flexibility. Since advances in power electronics enable the choice of an operating frequency, tools are needed to make this choice. In order to quantify the advantages as functions of frequency, this paper provides models for steady state calculations with frequency as a variable and validates the modeling assumptions. It then introduces an analytical quantification of the power flow capacity of a transmission branch as a function of frequency, demonstrating different active constraints across the range of frequency. The modeling and power flow calculations are demonstrated for a practical transmission line using manufacturer data. The models presented here provide a foundation for system level studies with variable frequency using optimal power flow.

Many emerging multimedia streaming applications involve multiple users communicating under strict latency constraints. In this paper we study streaming codes for a network involving two source nodes, one relay node and a destination node. In our setting, each source node transmits a stream of messages, through the relay, to a destination, who is required to decode the messages under a strict delay constraint. For the case of a single source node, a class of streaming codes has been proposed by Fong et al.[2], using the concept ofdelay-spectrum. In the present work we present an in-depth analysis of the properties of delay-spectrum and apply them to develop streaming codes for our proposed setting through a novel framework. Our first scheme involves greedily selecting the rate on the link from relay to destination and using properties of the delay-spectrum to find feasible streaming codes that satisfy the required delay constraints. We provide a closed form expression for the achievable rate region and identify conditions when the proposed scheme is optimal by establishing a natural outer bound. Our second scheme builds upon this approach, but uses a numerical optimization-based approach to improve the achievable rate region over the first scheme. We demonstrate that our proposed schemes achieve significant improvements over baseline schemes based on single-user codes.

[2101.11122] Named Entity Recognition in the Style of Object Detection	Bing		libi@microsoft.com	In this work, we propose a two-stage method for named entity recognition (NER), especially for nested NER. We borrowed the idea from the two-stage Object Detection in computer vision and the way how they construct the loss function. First, a region proposal network generates region candidates and then a second-stage model discriminates and classifies the entity and makes the final prediction. We also designed a special loss function for the second-stage training that predicts the entityness and entity type at the same time. The model is built on top of pretrained BERT encoders, and we tried both BERT base and BERT large models. For experiments, we first applied it to flat NER tasks such as CoNLL2003 and OntoNotes 5.0 and got comparable results with traditional NER models using sequence labeling methodology. We then tested the model on the nested named entity recognition task ACE2005 and Genia, and got F1 score of 85.6and 76.8respectively. In terms of the second-stage training, we found that adding extra randomly selected regions plays an important role in improving the precision. We also did error profiling to better evaluate the performance of the model in different circumstances for potential improvements in the future.

In particular, its low electronic density and moderate disorder make it a suitable candidate for the fabrication of large inductances with low losses at microwave frequencies. We study experimentally the electrodynamics of superconducting silicon thin layers using coplanar waveguide resonators, focusing on the kinetic inductance, the internal losses, and the variation of these quantities with the resonator read-out power. We report the first observation in a doped semiconductor of microwave resonances with internal quality factors of a few thousand. As expected in the BCS framework, superconducting silicon presents a large sheet kinetic inductance in the 50-500 pH range, comparable to strongly disordered superconductors. The kinetic inductance temperature dependence is well described by Mattis-Bardeen theory. However, we find an unexpectedly strong non-linearity of the complex surface impedance that cannot be satisfyingly explained either by depairing or by quasiparticle heating.

The independent set is maximal if no node outside the independent set can join it. In network applications, maximal independent sets can be used as cluster heads in ad hoc and wireless sensor networks. In order to deal with any failure in networks, self-stabilizing algorithms have been proposed in the literature to calculate the maximal independent set under different hypothesis.In this paper, we propose a self-stabilizing algorithm to compute a maximal independent set where nodes of the independent set are far from each other at least with distance 3. We prove the correctness and the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Simulation tests show the ability of our algorithm to find a reduced number of nodes in large scale networks which allows strong control of networks.Keywords: Self-stabilizing algorithm, distributed system, network, independent set.

Currently, there is a drive to implement field programmable photonic circuits, a need which is only magnified by new neuromorphic and quantum computing applications. The most promising non-volatile photonic components employ phase change materials such as GST and GSST, which had their origin in electronic memory. However, in the optical domain, these compounds introduce significant losses potentially preventing a large number of applications. Here, we evaluate the use of two newly introduced low loss phase change materials, Sb2S3and Sb2Se3, on a silicon nitride photonic platform. We focus the study on Mach–Zehnder interferometers that operate at the O and C bands to demonstrate the performance of the system. Our measurements show an insertion loss belowfor Sb2S3and lower thanfor Sb2Se3cladded devices for both amorphous and crystalline phases. The effective refractive index contrast for Sb2S3on SiNx was measured to be 0.05 at 1310 nm and 0.02 at 1550 nm, whereas for Sb2Se3, it was 0.03 at 1310 nm and 0.05 at 1550 nm highlighting the performance of the integrated device.	
[2101.11128] Invariant Forms in Hybrid and Impact Systems and a Taming of Zeno			abloch@umich.edu wac76@cornell.edu	Hybrid (and impact) systems are dynamical systems experiencing both continuous and discrete transitions. In this work, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for when a given differential form is invariant, with special attention paid to the case of the existence of invariant volumes. Particular attention is given to impact systems where the continuous dynamics are Lagrangian and subject to nonholonomic constraints. A celebrated result for volume-preserving dynamical systems is Poincaré recurrence. In order to be recurrent, trajectories need to exist for long periods of time, which can be controlled in continuous-time systems through e.g. compactness. For hybrid systems, an additional mechanism can occur which breaks long-time existence: Zeno (infinitely many discrete transitions in a finite amount of time). We demonstrate that the existence of a smooth invariant volume severely inhibits Zeno behavior; hybrid systems with the “boundary identity property” along with an invariant volume-form have almost no Zeno trajectories (although Zeno trajectories can still exist). This leads to the result that many billiards (e.g. the classical point, the rolling disk, and the rolling ball) are recurrent independent on the shape of the compact table-top.

This mapping has been previously established for non-rotating black holes. We show that, the shadow seen by an distant observer at a given inclination angle, can be mapped to a family of quasinormal modes withbounded within certain range, whereis is azimuthal node number andis the angular node number. We discuss the possibility of testing such relation with space-borne gravitational wave detectors and the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope.	
[2101.11130] Constraints on Planets in Nearby Young Moving Groups Detectable by High-Contrast Imaging and Gaia Astrometry	A. L. Wallace, M. J. Ireland, C. FederrathResearch School of Astronomy & Astrophysics, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 2611, Australia	E-mail:	alexander.wallace@anu.edu.auE michael.ireland@anu.edu.au	The formation of giant planets can be studied through direct imaging by observing planets both during and after formation. Giant planets are expected to form either by core accretion, which is typically associated with low initial entropy (cold-start models) or by gravitational instability, associated with high initial entropy of the gas (hot-start models). Thus, constraining the initial entropy can provide insight into a planet’s formation process and determines the resultant brightness evolution. In this study, we find that, by observing planets in nearby moving groups of known age both through direct imaging and astrometry with Gaia, it will be possible to constrain the initial entropy of giant planets. We simulate a set of planetary systems in stars in nearby moving groups identified by BANYANand assume a model for planet distribution consistent with radial velocity detections. We find that Gaia should be able to detect approximately 25% of planets in nearby moving groups greater than. Using 5contrast limits of current and future instruments, we calculate the flux uncertainty, and using models for the evolution of the planet brightness, we convert this to an initial entropy uncertainty. We find that future instruments such as METIS on E-ELT as well as GRAVITY and VIKiNG with VLTI should be able to constrain the entropy to within 0.5/baryon, which implies that these instruments should be able to distinguish between hot and cold-start models.	gaseous planets – formation – detection

Here, we introduce the corpus of Chinese linguistic minimal pairs (CLiMP), which can be used to investigate what knowledge Chinese LMs acquire. CLiMP consists of sets of 1,000 minimal pairs (MPs) for 16 syntactic contrasts in Mandarin, covering 9 major Mandarin linguistic phenomena. The MPs are semi-automatically generated, and human agreement with the labels in CLiMP is. We evaluate 11 different LMs on CLiMP, coveringn-grams, LSTMs, and Chinese BERT. We find that classifier–noun agreement and verb complement selection are the phenomena that models generally perform best at. However, models struggle the most with thebǎconstruction, binding, and filler-gap dependencies. Overall, Chinese BERT achieves anaverage accuracy, while the performances of LSTMs and 5-grams are only moderately above chance level.

[2101.11133] Route Choice-based Socio-Technical Macroscopic Traffic Model	Tanushree RoyDepartment of Mechanical EngineeringThe Pennsylvania State UniversityUniversity Park, PA 16802,  DeyDepartment of Mechanical EngineeringThe Pennsylvania State UniversityUniversity Park, PA 16802,		tbr5281@psu.edu skd5685@psu.edu	Human route choice is undeniably one of the key contributing factors towards traffic dynamics. However, most existing macroscopic traffic models are typically concerned with driving behavior and do not incorporate human route choice behavior models in their formulation. In this paper, we propose a socio-technical macroscopic traffic model that characterizes the traffic states using human route choice attributes. Essentially, such model provides a framework for capturing the Cyber-Physical-Social coupling in smart transportation systems. To derive this model, we first use Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) to model the human passengers’ route choice under bounded rationality. These choices are assumed to be influenced by traffic alerts and other incomplete traffic information. Next, we assume that the vehicles are operating under a non-cooperative cruise control scenario. Accordingly, human route choice segregates the traffic into multiple classes where each class corresponds to a specific route between an origin-destination pair. Thereafter, we derive a Mean Field Game (MFG) limit of this non-cooperative game to obtain a macroscopic model which embeds the human route choice attribute. Finally, we analyze the mathematical characteristics of the proposed model and present simulation studies to illustrate the model behavior.

However, the implementation of SDS capable of responding to every conceivable user utterance in an informative way is a challenging problem. Multi-domain SDS must necessarily identify and deal with out-of-domain (OOD) utterances to generate appropriate responses as users do not always know in advance what domains the SDS can handle. To address this problem, we extend the current state-of-the-art in multi-domain SDS by estimating the topic of OOD utterances using external knowledge representation from Wikipedia. Experimental results on real human-to-human dialogues showed that our approach does not degrade domain prediction performance when compared to the base model. But more significantly, our joint training achieves more accurate predictions of the nearest Wikipedia article by up to about 30% when compared to the benchmarks.	
[2101.11135] Boosting segmentation performance across datasets using histogram specification with application to pelvic bone segmentation				Accurate segmentation of the pelvic CTs is crucial for the clinical diagnosis of pelvic bone diseases and for planning patient-specific hip surgeries. With the emergence and advancements of deep learning for digital healthcare, several methodologies have been proposed for such segmentation tasks. But in a low data scenario, the lack of abundant data needed to train a Deep Neural Network is a significant bottle-neck. In this work, we propose a methodology based on modulation of image tonal distributions and deep learning to boost the performance of networks trained on limited data. The strategy involves pre-processing of test data through histogram specification. This simple yet effective approach can be viewed as a style transfer methodology. The segmentation task uses a U-Net configuration with an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, optimized using an augmented BCE-IoU loss function. This configuration is validated on a total of 284 images taken from two publicly available CT datasets, TCIA (a cancer imaging archive) and the Visible Human Project. The average performance measures for the Dice coefficient and Intersection over Union are 95.7% and 91.9%, respectively, give strong evidence for the effectiveness of the approach, which is highly competitive with state-of-the-art methodologies.

With the recent uptick in the identification of candidate and confirmed exoplanets through the work of missions like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\tess), we are beginning to understand that Earth-like planets are common. In this work, we extend the Breakthrough Listen (BL) search for extraterrestrial intelligence to include targeted searches of stars identified by\tessas potential exoplanet hosts. We report on30-min cadence observations collected for 28 targets selected from the\tessInput Catalog (TIC) from among those identified as containing signatures of transiting planets. The targets were searched for narrowband signals from 1 – 11 GHz using the turboSETI(Enriquez et al.,2017; Enriquez & Price,2019)pipeline architecture modified for compatibility with the Google Cloud environment. Data were searched for drift rates ofHz / s above a minimum signal-to-noise threshold of, following the parameters of previous searches conducted byPrice et al. (2020)andEnriquez et al. (2017). The observations presented in this work establish some of the deepest limits to date over such a wide band (1 – 11 GHz) for life beyond Earth. We determine that fewer thanof the observed targets possess transmitters operating at these frequencies with an Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) greater than our derived threshold ofW.	exoplanets — technosignatures — search for extraterrestrial intelligence

[2101.11139] A Strengthened Cutset Upper Bound on the Capacity of the Relay Channel and Applications	Abbas El Gamal, Amin Gohari and Chandra Nair			We develop a new upper bound on the capacity of the relay channel that is tighter than previously known upper bounds. This upper bound is proved using traditional weak converse techniques involving mutual information inequalities and Gallager-type explicit identification of auxiliary random variables. We show that the new upper bound is strictly tighter than all previous bounds for the Gaussian relay channel with non-zero channel gains. When specialized to the relay channel with orthogonal receiver components, the bound resolves a conjecture by Kim on a class of deterministic relay channels. When further specialized to the class of product-form relay channels with orthogonal receiver components, the bound resolves a generalized version of Cover’s relay channel problem, recovers the recent upper bound for the Gaussian case by Wu et al., and improves upon the recent bounds for the binary symmetric case by Wu et al. and Barnes et al., which were obtained using non-traditional geometric proof techniques. For the special class of a relay channel with orthogonal receiver components, we develop another upper bound on the capacity which utilizes an auxiliary receiver and show that it is strictly tighter than the bound by Tandon and Ulukus. Finally, we show through the Gaussian relay channel with i.i.d. relay output sequence that the bound with the auxiliary receiver can be strictly tighter than our main bound.111This paper was presented in part at the IEEE Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) 2021.

In this version Section IV compares the performance of the angular droop controller to standard frequency droop control.The authors are with the Department of Automatic Control LTH Lund University Naturvetarvägen 18 223 62 Lund Sweden. E-mails:{taouba.jouini anders.rantzer 		In inverse optimal control, the optimality of a given feedback stabilizing controller is a byproduct of the choice of a meaningful, a posteriori defined, cost functional. This allows for a simple tuning comparable to linear quadratic control, also for nonlinear controllers. Our work illustrates the usefulness of this approach in the control of converter-based power systems and networked systems in general, and thereby in finding controllers with topological structure and known optimality properties. In particular,we design an inverse optimal feedback controller that stabilizes the phase angles of voltage-source controlled DC/AC converters at an induced steady state withzerofrequency error. The distributed angular droop controller yields active power to angle droop behavior at steady state. Moreover, we suggest a practical implementation of the controller and corroborate our results through simulations on a three-converter system and a numerical comparison with standard frequency droop control.	
[2101.11142] Fate of a bulge in an inflated hyperleastic tube: theory and experiment	Masoud Hejazi111Department of Mechanical engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, CanadaYork Hsiang222Department of Surgery, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, CanadaA. Srikantha Phani333Corresponding Author: Department of Mechanical engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.  .		phani@mech.ubc.ca	Mechanical instability in a pre-tensioned finite hyperelastic tube subjected to a slowly increasing internal pressure produces a spatially localized bulge at a critical pressure. The subsequent fate of the bulge, under continued inflation, is critically governed by the end-conditions, and the initial tension in the tube. In a tube with one end fixed and a dead weight attached to the other freely moving end, the bulge propagates axially at low initial tension, growing in length and the tube relaxes by extension. Rupture occurs when the tension is high. In contrast, the bulge formed in a tube, initially stretched and held fixed at both its ends can buckle or rupture, depending on the amount of initial tension. Experiments on inflated latex rubber tubes are presented for different initial tensions and boundary conditions. Failure maps in the stretch parameter space and in stretch-tension space are constructed, by extending the theories for bulge formation and buckling analyses to the experimentally relevant boundary conditions. The fate of the bulge according to the failure maps deduced from the theory is verified; the underlying assumptions are critically assessed. It is concluded that buckling provides an alternate route to relieve the stress built up during inflation. Hence buckling, when it occurs, is a protective fail safe mechanism against the rupture of a bulge in an inflated elastic tube.

A collaborative data analysis through sharing dimensionality reduced representations of data has been proposed as a non-model sharing-type federated learning. This paper analyzes the accuracy and privacy evaluations of this novel framework. In the accuracy analysis, we provided sufficient conditions for the equivalence of the collaborative data analysis and the centralized analysis with dimensionality reduction. In the privacy analysis, we proved that collaborative users’ private datasets are protected with a double privacy layer against insider and external attacking scenarios.	
[2101.11145] Local saddles of relaxed averaged alternating reflections algorithms on phase retrieval	Pengwen Chen	Applied mathematics National Chung Hsing University 	pengwen@nchu.edu.tw	Phase retrieval can be expressed as a non-convex constrained optimization problem to identify one phase minimizer one a torus. Many iterative transform techniques have been proposed to identify the minimizer, e.g., relaxed averaged alternating reflections(RAAR) algorithms. In this paper, we present one optimization viewpoint on the RAAR algorithm. RAAR algorithm is one alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM) with one penalty parameter. Pairing with multipliers (dual vectors), phase vectors on the primal space are lifted to higher dimensional vectors, RAAR algorithm is one continuation algorithm, which searches for local saddles in the primal-dual space. The dual iteration approximates one gradient ascent flow, which drives the corresponding local minimizers in a positive-definite Hessian region. Altering penalty parameters, the RAAR avoids the stagnation of these corresponding local minimizers in the primal space and thus screens out many stationary points corresponding to non-local minimizers.

Stein	thanks:	lcstein@olemiss.edu wfarr@flatironinstitute.org mokounkova@flatironinstitute.org maxisi@mit.edu	We perform a new test of general relativity (GR) with signals from GWTC-2, the LIGO and Virgo catalog of gravitational wave detections. We search for the presence of amplitude birefringence, in which left versus right circularly polarized modes of gravitational waves are exponentially enhanced and suppressed during propagation. Such an effect is present in various beyond-GR theories but is absent in GR. We constrain the amount of amplitude birefringence consistent with the data through an opacity parameter, which we bound to be. Our constraint is derived under an assumption that all GWTC-2 events have a common distance. This result foris statistically significant, with a Jensen-Shannon divergence ofbits compared to an uninformative distribution on. We then use these theory-agnostic results to constrain Chern-Simons gravity, a beyond-GR theory with motivations in quantum gravity. We bound the canonical Chern-Simons lengthscale to bekm, in agreement with other long-distance measurement results.

Our result is achieved by a generalization of the adaptive interpolation method in Bayesian inference for linear regimes to sub-linear ones. A modification of the well-known approximate message passing algorithm to approach the MMSE fundamental limit is also proposed, and its state evolution is rigorously analysed. Our results show that the traditional linear assumption between the signal dimension and number of observations in the replica and adaptive interpolation methods is not necessary for sparse signals. They also show how to modify the existing well-known AMP algorithms for linear regimes to sub-linear ones.

[2101.11158] Maximizing performance of quantum cascade laser-pumped molecular lasers	Fan Wang Steven G. Johnson Henry O. Everitt	Department of Mathematics Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge MA 02139 USA		Quantum cascade laser(QCL)-pumped molecular lasers (QPMLs) have recently been introduced as a new source of powerful (1 mW), tunable (1 THz), narrow-band (10 kHz), continuous-wave terahertz radiation. The performance of these lasers depends critically on molecular collision physics, pump saturation, and on the design of the laser cavity. Using a validated three-level model that captures the essential collision and saturation behaviors of the QPML gas nitrous oxide (NO), we explore how threshold pump power and output terahertz power depend on pump power, gas pressure, as well as on the diameter, length, and output-coupler transmissivity of a cylindrical cavity. The analysis indicates that maximum power occurs as pump saturation is minimized in a manner that depends much more sensitively on pressure than on cell diameter, length, or transmissivity.A near-optimal compact laser cavity can produce more than 10 mW of power tunable over frequencies above 1 THz when pumped by a multi-watt QCL.	
[2101.11159] An Early Stopping Bayesian Data Assimilation Approach for Mixed-Logit Estimation	Shanshan Xie Tim Hillel Ying Jin	of Architecture 1-5 Scroope Terrace Cambridge CB2 1PX the United Kingdom	Ying.Jin@aha.cam.ac.uk tim.hillel@epfl.ch sx239@cam.ac.uk	The mixed-logit model is a flexible tool in transportation choice analysis, which provides valuable insights into inter and intra-individual behavioural heterogeneity. However, applications of mixed-logit models in practice are limited by the high computational and data requirements for model estimation. When estimating mixed-logit models on small samples, theBayesianestimation approach becomes vulnerable to over and under-fitting. This is problematic for investigating the behaviour of specific population sub-groups or market segments, where a modeller may wish to estimate separate models for multiple similar contexts, each with low data availability. Similar challenges arise when adapting an existing model to a new location or time period, e.g., when estimating post-pandemic travel behaviour.

Rowley	Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Princeton University Princeton NJ	sotto@princeton.edu	Sensor placement and feature selection are critical steps in engineering, modeling, and data science that share a common mathematical theme: the selected measurements should enable solution of an inverse problem. Most real-world systems of interest are nonlinear, yet the majority of available techniques for feature selection and sensor placement rely on assumptions of linearity or simple statistical models. We show that when these assumptions are violated, standard techniques can lead to costly over-sensing without guaranteeing that the desired information can be recovered from the measurements. In order to remedy these problems, we introduce a novel data-driven approach for sensor placement and feature selection for a general type of nonlinear inverse problem based on the information contained in secant vectors between data points. Using the secant-based approach, we develop three efficient greedy algorithms that each provide different types of robust, near-minimal reconstruction guarantees. We demonstrate them on two problems where linear techniques consistently fail: sensor placement to reconstruct a fluid flow formed by a complicated shock-mixing layer interaction and selecting fundamental manifold learning coordinates on a torus.

[2101.11163] Consistent approximation of fractional order operators	Yiheng Wei YangQuan Chen Yingdong Wei Xuefeng Zhang	School of Mathematics Southeast University Nanjing 211189 ChinaEmail:	ychen53@ucmerced.edu kb8@mail.ustc.edu.cn neudawei@ustc.edu.cn zhangxuefeng@mail.neu.edu.cn	Fractional order controllers become increasingly popular due to their versatility and superiority in various performance. However, the bottleneck in deploying these tools in practice is related to their analog or numerical implementation. Numerical approximations are usually employed in which the approximation of fractional differintegrator is the foundation. Generally, the following three identical equations always hold, i.e.,,and. However, for the approximate models of fractional differintegrator,, there usually exist some conflicts on the mentioned equations, which might enlarge the approximation error or even cause fallacies in multiple orders occasion. To overcome the conflicts, this brief develops a piecewise approximate model and provides two procedures for designing the model parameters. The comparison with several existing methods shows that the proposed methods do not only satisfy the equalities but also achieve high approximation accuracy. From this, it is believed that this work can serve for simulation and realization of fractional order controllers more friendly.

Main St.Eureka, IL 61530–1035		Tony.Grichnik@BlueRoofLabs.com tatiana.kalganova@brunel.ac.uk abyerly@fsmail.bradley.edu	We present a dataset consisting of high-resolution images of 13 micro-PCBs captured in various rotations and perspectives relative to the camera, with each sample labeled for PCB type, rotation category, and perspective categories. We then present the design and results of experimentation on combinations of rotations and perspectives used during training and the resulting impact on test accuracy. We then show when and how well data augmentation techniques are capable of simulating rotations vs. perspectives not present in the training data. We perform all experiments using CNNs with and without homogeneous vector capsules (HVCs) and investigate and show the capsules’ ability to better encode the equivariance of the sub-components of the micro-PCBs. The results of our experiments lead us to conclude that training a neural network equipped with HVCs, capable of modeling equivariance among sub-components, coupled with training on a diversity of perspectives, achieves the greatest classification accuracy on micro-PCB data.

Email:  Mailing address: Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Ottawa, 150 Louis-Pasteur Private, Ottawa, ON, K1N 6N5, Canada.and Andrew WagnerUniversity of Ottawa		msajna@uottawa.ca	AnEuler tourin a hypergraph is a closed walk that traverses each edge of the hypergraph exactly once, while anEuler familyis a family of closed walks that jointly traverse each edge exactly once and cannot be concatenated. In this paper, we show how the problem of existence of an Euler tour (family) in a hypergraphcan be reduced to the analogous problem in some smaller hypergraphs that are derived fromusing an edge cut of. In the process, new techniques ofedge cut assignmentsandcollapsed hypergraphsare introduced. Moreover, we describe algorithms based on these characterizations that determine whether or not a hypergraph admits an Euler tour (family), and can also construct an Euler tour (family) if it exists.	
[2101.11169] A proposal to improve Ni-based superconductors	Zi-Jian Lang  Ruoshi Jiang  Wei Ku	Tsung-Dao Lee Institute & School of Physics and Astronomy Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai 200240 China	weiku@sjtu.edu.cn	Recently discovered superconductivity in hole-doped nickelate NdSrNiOcaught intensive attention in the field. An immediate question is how to improve its superconducting properties. Guided by the key characteristics of electronic structures of the cuprates and the nickelates, we propose that nickel chalcogenides with a similar lattice structure should be a promising family of materials. Using NdNiSas an example, we find this particular crystal structure a stable one, through first-principle structural optimization and phonon calculation. We justify our proposal by comparing with CaCuOand NdNiOthe strength of the charge-transfer characteristics and the trend in their low-energy many-body effective Hamiltonians of doped hole carriers. These analysis indicates that nickel chalcogenides host low-energy physics closer to that of the cuprates, with stronger magnetic interaction than the nickelates, and thus deserve further experimental exploration. Our proposal also opens up the possibility of a wide range of parameter tuning through ligand substitution among chalcogenides, to further improve superconducting properties.

One possible explanation of the first peak would be shock-cooling emission from massive extended material around the progenitor, which is produced by mass eruption or rapid expansion of the outermost layers of the progenitor shortly before the supernova explosion. We investigate the effects of such circumstellar matter (CSM) on the multi-band optical light curves of SNe Ic using the radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. Two different SNe Ic progenitor masses at the pre-SN stage (3.93and 8.26) are considered in the SN models. The adopted parameter space consists of the CSM mass of, the CSM radius ofcm and the explosion energy oferg. We also investigate the effects of the radioactive nickel distribution on the overall shape of the light curve and the color evolution. Comparison of our SN models with the double peaked SNe Ic LSQ14efd, iPTF15dtg and SN 2020bvc indicate that these three SNe Ic had a similar CSM structure (i.e.,and), which might imply a common mechanism for the CSM formation. The implied mass loss rate ofis too high to be explained by the previously suggested scenarios for pre-SN eruption, which calls for a novel mechanism.

Based on the widely-used W-stacking method, we propose a new wide-field imaging algorithm that can synthesize visibility data from a model of the sky brightness via degridding, able to construct dirty maps from measured visibility data via gridding. Results carry the smallest approximation error yet achieved relative to the exact calculation involving the direct Fourier transform. In contrast to the original W-stacking method, the new algorithm performs least-misfit optimal gridding (and degridding) in all three directions, and is capable of achieving much higher accuracy than is feasible with the original algorithm. In particular, accuracy at the level of single precision arithmetic is readily achieved by choosing a least-misfit convolution function of widthand an image cropping parameter of. If the accuracy required is only that attained by the original W-stacking method, the computational cost for both the gridding and FFT steps can be substantially reduced using the proposed method by making an appropriate choice of the width and image cropping parameters.	techniques: interferometric – techniques: image processing – methods: analytical – methods: observational – methods: data analysis

[2101.11174] Graph Neural Network for Traffic Forecasting: A Survey	Weiwei Jiang Jiayun Luo	Department of Electronic Engineering Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 China		Traffic forecasting is important for the success of intelligent transportation systems. Deep learning models, including convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have been extensively applied in traffic forecasting problems to model spatial and temporal dependencies. In recent years, to model the graph structures in transportation systems as well as contextual information, graph neural networks have been introduced and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a series of traffic forecasting problems. In this survey, we review the rapidly growing body of research using different graph neural networks, e.g. graph convolutional and graph attention networks, in various traffic forecasting problems, e.g. road traffic flow and speed forecasting, passenger flow forecasting in urban rail transit systems, and demand forecasting in ride-hailing platforms. We also present a comprehensive list of open data and source codes for each problem and identify future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first comprehensive survey that explores the application of graph neural networks for traffic forecasting problems. We have also created a public GitHub repository where the latest papers, open data, and source codes will be updated.

In most cases we conjectured that these were the only decomposable Specht modules labelled by bihooks, proving it in some instances. Inspired by a recent semisimplicity result of Bowman, Bessenrodt and the third author, we look back at our decomposable Specht modules and show that they are often either semisimple, or very close to being so. We obtain their exact structure and composition factors in these cases. In the process, we determine the graded decomposition numbers for almost all of the decomposable Specht modules indexed by bihooks.	
[2101.11176] Observation of photon recoil effects in single-beam absorption spectroscopy with an ultracold strontium gas	Fachao Hu Canzhu Tan Yuhai Jiang Matthias Weidemüller Bing Zhu	These authors contributed equally to this work.	jiangyh@sari.ac.cn bzhu@physi.uni-heidelberg.de weidemueller@uni-heidelberg.de	We report on observing photon recoil effects in the absorption of a single monochromatic light at 689 nm through an ultracoldSr gas, where the recoil frequency is comparable to natural linewidth of the narrow-line transitionin strontium. In the regime of high-saturation, the absorption profile becomes asymmetric due to the photon-recoil shift, which is of the same order as the natural linewidth. The lineshape is described by an extension of the optical Bloch equations including the momentum transfers to atoms during emission and absorption of photons. Our work reveals the photon recoil effects in a simplest single-beam absorption setting, which is of significant relevance to other applications such as saturation spectroscopy, Ramsey interferometry, and absorption imaging.

These tuples are useful for downstream tasks in natural language processing like knowledge base creation, textual entailment, and natural language understanding. However, current OIE datasets are limited in both size and diversity. We introduce a new dataset by converting theqa-srl2.0 dataset to a large-scale OIE dataset (lsoie). Ourlsoiedataset is 20 times larger than the next largest human-annotated OIE dataset. We construct and evaluate several benchmark OIE models onlsoie, providing baselines for future improvements on the task.

[2101.11178] Neural Sentence Ordering Based on Constraint Graphs	Yutao Zhu, Kun Zhou, Jian-Yun Nie, Shengchao Liu, Zhicheng Dou			Sentence ordering aims at arranging a list of sentences in the correct order. Based on the observation that sentence order at different distances may rely on different types of information, we devise a new approach based on multi-granular orders between sentences. These orders form multiple constraint graphs, which are then encoded by Graph Isomorphism Networks and fused into sentence representations. Finally, sentence order is determined using the order-enhanced sentence representations. Our experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms all the existing baselines significantly, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrate the advantage of considering multiple types of order information and using graph neural networks to integrate sentence content and order information for the task. Our code is available athttps://github.com/DaoD/ConstraintGraph4NSO.

It has been acknowledged that weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and cloud density can significantly impact the emergence and position of solar ramping events. As a result, modeling these events with complex spatio-temporal correlations is highly challenging. To tackle the question, we adopt a novel spatio-temporal categorical point process model, which intuitively and effectively addresses correlation and interaction among ramping events. We demonstrate the interpretability and predictive power of our model on extensive real-data experiments.	spatio-temporal point process |

[2101.11181] A Generative Model of Galactic Dust Emission Using Variational Inference	Ben Thorne,Lloyd Knox,and Karthik PrabhuDepartment of Physics, University of California, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, USA	E-mail:	blthorne@ucdavis.edu	Emission from the interstellar medium can be a significant contaminant of measurements of the intensity and polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). For planning CMB observations, and for optimizing foreground-cleaning algorithms, a description of the statistical properties of such emission can be helpful. Here we examine a machine learning approach to inferring the statistical properties of dust from either observational data or physics-based simulations. In particular, we apply a type of neural network called a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) to maps of the intensity of emission from interstellar dust as inferred fromPlancksky maps and demonstrate its ability to a) simulate new samples with similar summary statistics as the training set, b) provide fits to emission maps withheld from the training set, and c) produce constrained realizations. We find VAEs are easier to train than another popular architecture: that of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and are better-suited for use in Bayesian inference.	cosmology: cosmic microwave background – ISM: general – methods:statistical

[2101.11183] DeepOIS: Gyroscope-Guided Deep Optical Image Stabilizer Compensation	Haipeng LiShuaicheng LiuJue WangMegvii TechnologyUniversity of Electronic Science and Technology of China			Mobile captured images can be aligned using their gyroscope sensors. Optical image stabilizer (OIS) terminates this possibility by adjusting the images during the capturing. In this work, we propose a deep network that compensates the motions caused by the OIS, such that the gyroscopes can be used for image alignment on the OIS cameras111Code will be available onhttps://github.com/lhaippp/DeepOIS.. To achieve this, first, we record both videos and gyroscopes with an OIS camera as training data. Then, we convert gyroscope readings into motion fields. Second, we propose a Fundamental Mixtures motion model for rolling shutter cameras, where an array of rotations within a frame are extracted as the ground-truth guidance. Third, we train a convolutional neural network with gyroscope motions as input to compensate for the OIS motion. Once finished, the compensation network can be applied for other scenes, where the image alignment is purely based on gyroscopes with no need for images contents, delivering strong robustness. Experiments show that our results are comparable with that of non-OIS cameras, and outperform image-based alignment results with a relatively large margin.

Up to equivalence, its objects are hereditarily atomic von Neumann algebras equipped with quantum partial orders in Weaver’s sense. We show that this category is complete, cocomplete and symmetric monoidal closed. As a consequence, any discrete quantum family of maps from a discrete quantum space to a partially ordered set is canonically equipped with a quantum preorder. In particular, the quantum power set of a quantum set is canonically a quantum poset. We show that each quantum poset embeds into its quantum power set in complete analogy with the classical case.

Toyohashi University of Technology Toyohashi 441-8580 JapanEmail:	takeuchi@ee.tut.ac.jp	To improve the convergence property of approximate message-passing (AMP), convolutional AMP (CAMP) has been proposed. CAMP replaces the Onsager correction in AMP with a convolution of messages in all preceding iterations while it uses the same low-complexity matched filter (MF) as AMP. This paper derives state evolution (SE) equations to design the Bayes-optimal denoiser in CAMP. Numerical results imply that CAMP with the Bayes-optimal denoiser—called Bayes-optimal CAMP—can achieve the Bayes-optimal performance for right-orthogonally invariant sensing matrices with low-to-moderate condition numbers.

However, GAN and its variants also suffer from many training problems, such as mode collapse and gradient vanish. In this paper, we firstly propose a general crossover operator, which can be widely applied to GANs using evolutionary strategies. Then we design an evolutionary GAN framework named C-GAN based on it. And we combine the crossover operator with evolutionary generative adversarial networks (E-GAN) to implement the evolutionary generative adversarial networks with crossover (CE-GAN). Under the premise that a variety of loss functions are used as mutation operators to generate mutation individuals, we evaluate the generated samples and allow the mutation individuals to learn experiences from the output in a knowledge distillation manner, imitating the best output outcome, resulting in better offspring. Then, we greedily select the best offspring as parents for subsequent training using discriminator as an evaluator. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CE-GAN and show that our method is competitive in terms of generated images quality and time efficiency.

Rheological results showed that the consistency of these systems increased initially during roughly the first week of aging, which was succeeded by little changes in consistency (systems containing from 30% to 70% C18, with the 50% C18 system showing the highest consistencies) or significant breakdown of structure (remaining systems). The formation and/or disintegration of all ternary systems were also detected by microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry experiments. This study emphasizes the fact that the structure and consistency of ternary systems are dominantly controlled by the swelling capacity of the lamellar gel phase. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to provide details on the molecular mechanism of stability. Computational results support the hypothesis experimentally proposed for the stability of the mixed system being due to an increase flexibility of the alcohol with a longer hydrocarbon chain. Computational results are in excellent agreement with experimental conclusions. Additionally, they show that in the mixed system, alcohols with shorter hydrocarbon chain become more rigid. These molecular details could not be available in experimental measurements.	Keywords

The academic community have explored different optimisation methods on these problems and initial results are encouraging. However, there exists significant friction in the lack of a simple, configurable, open-source framework for cellular offload research. Prior research utilises a variety of network simulators and system models, making it difficult to compare results. In this paper we present GymD2D, a framework for experimentation with physical layer resource allocation problems in device-to-device communication. GymD2D allows users to simulate a variety of cellular offload scenarios and to extend its behaviour to meet their research needs. GymD2D provides researchers an evaluation platform to compare, share and build upon previous research. We evaluated GymD2D with state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning and demonstrate these algorithms provide significant efficiency improvements.	device-to-device (D2D) communication | cellular offload | resource allocation | radio resource management | network simulator | deep reinforcement learning | OpenAI Gym

R. China. Emails: {zhangfeng01 wangxueying slzhou wangyingqian16 (Corresponding author: Xueying Wang)		Ship detection in remote sensing images plays a crucial role in various applications and has drawn increasing attention in recent years. However, existing arbitrary-oriented ship detection methods are generally developed on a set of predefined rotated anchor boxes. These predefined boxes not only lead to inaccurate angle predictions but also introduce extra hyper-parameters and high computational cost. Moreover, the prior knowledge of ship size has not been fully exploited by existing methods, which hinders the improvement of their detection accuracy. Aiming at solving the above issues, in this paper, we propose acenter-head point extraction based detector(named CHPDet) to achieve arbitrary-oriented ship detection in remote sensing images. Our CHPDet formulates arbitrary-oriented ships as rotated boxes with head points which are used to determine the direction. And rotated Gaussian kernel is used to map the annotations into target heatmaps. Keypoint estimation is performed to find the center of ships. Then, the size and head point of the ships are regressed. The orientation-invariant model (OIM) is also used to produce orientation-invariant feature maps. Finally, we use the target size as prior to finetune the results. Moreover, we introduce a new dataset for multi-class arbitrary-oriented ship detection in remote sensing images at a fixed ground sample distance (GSD) which is named FGSD2021. Experimental results on FGSD2021 and two other widely used data sets, i.e., HRSC2016, and UCAS-AOD demonstrate that our CHPDet achieves state-of-the-art performance and can well distinguish between bow and stern.

Hippe Shouyi Wang Jie Han Phawis Thammasorn Chunyan Duan Jing Zeng Stephen R. Bowen	Department of Industrial Engineering University of Arkansas		Boosting Trees are one of the most successful statistical learning approaches that involve sequentially growing an ensemble of simple regression trees (i.e., “weak learners”). This paper proposes a new gradientBoosted Trees algorithm forSpatial Data (Boost-S) for spatially correlated data with covariate information. Boost-S integrates the spatial correlation structure into the classical framework of gradient boosted trees. Each tree is grown by solving a regularized optimization problem, where the objective function involves two penalty terms on tree complexity and takes into account the underlying spatial correlation. A computationally-efficient algorithm is proposed to obtain the ensemble trees. The proposed Boost-S is applied to the spatially-correlated FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography) imaging data collected during cancer chemoradiotherapy. Our numerical investigations successfully demonstrate the advantages of the proposed Boost-S over existing approaches for this particular application.	Key words:

We find that for QMDD model these mass and tidal deformability observations would rule out the existence of strange stars if non-Newtonian gravity effects are ignored. For the current quark masses ofMeV,MeV, andMeV, we find that a strange star can exist for values of the non-Newtonian gravity parameterin the range of 4.58 GeV9.32 GeV, and that the parametersandof the QMDD model are restricted to 158.3 MeV181.2 MeV and. It is found that the largest possible maximum mass of a strange star obtained with the QMDD model is, and that the secondary component of GW190814 with a mass ofcould not be a static strange star. We also find that for the mass and radius of PSR J0030+0451 given by Riley et al. through the analysis of observational data of NICER, there exists a very tiny allowed parameter space for which strange stars computed for the QMDD model agree with the observations of PSR J0740+6620, GW170817 and PSR J0030+0451 simultaneously. However, for the mass and radius given by Miller et al., no such parameter space exist.

We perform a dynamical calculation of the possible hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks with triple strangeness by the one-boson-exchange model, where the-wave mixing effect and the coupled channel effect are taken into account in our calculation. Our results suggest that thestate withand thestate withcan be recommended as the candidates of the hidden-charm molecular pentaquark with triple strangeness. Furthermore, we discuss the two-body hidden-charm strong decay behaviors of these possible hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks with triple strangeness by adopting the quark-interchange model. These predictions are expected to be tested at the LHCb, which can be as a potential research issue with more accumulated experimental data in near future.

[2101.11202] Change point detection and image segmentation for time series of astrophysical images	Cong Xu Hans Moritz Günther Vinay L. Kashyap Thomas C. M. Lee Andreas Zezas	Department of Statistics University of California Davis One Shields Avenue Davis CA 95616 USA		Many astrophysical phenomena are time-varying, in the sense that their intensity, energy spectrum, and/or the spatial distribution of the emission suddenly change. This paper develops a method for modeling a time series of images. Under the assumption that the arrival times of the photons follow a Poisson process, the data are binned into 4D grids of voxels (time, energy band, and x-y coordinates), and viewed as a time series of non-homogeneous Poisson images. The method assumes that at each time point, the corresponding multi-band image stack is an unknown 3D piecewise constant function including Poisson noise. It also assumes that all image stacks between any two adjacent change points (in time domain) share the same unknown piecewise constant function. The proposed method is designed to estimate the number and the locations of all the change points (in time domain), as well as all the unknown piecewise constant functions between any pairs of the change points. The method applies the minimum description length (MDL) principle to perform this task. A practical algorithm is also developed to solve the corresponding complicated optimization problem. Simulation experiments and applications to real datasets show that the proposed method enjoys very promising empirical properties. Applications to two real datasets, the XMM observation of a flaring star and an emerging solar coronal loop, illustrate the usage of the proposed method and the scientific insight gained from it.

FL has received increasing attention in recent years thanks to its data privacy protection, communication efficiency and a linear speedup for convergence in training (i.e., convergence performance increases linearly with respect to the number of workers). However, existing studies on linear speedup for convergence are only limited to the assumptions of i.i.d. datasets across workers and/or full worker participation, both of which rarely hold in practice. So far, it remains an open question whether or not the linear speedup for convergence is achievable under non-i.i.d. datasets with partial worker participation in FL. In this paper, we show that the answer is affirmative. Specifically, we show that the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm (with two-sided learning rates) on non-i.i.d. datasets in non-convex settings achieves a convergence ratefor full worker participation and a convergence ratefor partial worker participation, whereis the number of local steps,is the number of total communication rounds,is the total worker number andis the worker number in one communication round if for partial worker participation. Our results also reveal that the local steps in FL could help the convergence and show that the maximum number of local steps can be improved toin full worker participation. We conduct extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 to verify our theoretical results.	
[2101.11204] Joint Coreference Resolution and Character Linking for Multiparty Conversation	Jiaxin Bai, Hongming Zhang, Yangqiu Song, and Kun XuCSE, HKUSTTencent AI Lab{jbai, hzhangal,		kxkunxu@tencent.com	Character linking, the task of linking mentioned people in conversations to the real world, is crucial for understanding the conversations. For the efficiency of communication, humans often choose to use pronouns (e.g., “she”) or normal phrases (e.g., “that girl”) rather than named entities (e.g., “Rachel”) in the spoken language, which makes linking those mentions to real people a much more challenging than a regular entity linking task. To address this challenge, we propose to incorporate the richer context from the coreference relations among different mentions to help the linking. On the other hand, considering that finding coreference clusters itself is not a trivial task and could benefit from the global character information, we propose to jointly solve these two tasks. Specifically, we propose C, the joint learning model ofCoreference resolution andCharacter linking. The experimental results demonstrate that Ccan significantly outperform previous works on both tasks. Further analyses are conducted to analyze the contribution of all modules in the proposed model and the effect of all hyper-parameters.

Fake news on social media does not exist independently in the form of an article. Many other entities, such as news creators, news subjects, and so on, exist on social media and have relationships with news articles. Different entities and relationships can be modeled as a heterogeneous information network (HIN). In this paper, we attempt to solve the fake news detection problem with the support of a news-oriented HIN. We propose a novel fake news detection framework, namelyAdversarialActive Learning-basedHeterogeneousGraphNeuralNetwork (AA-HGNN) which employs a novel hierarchical attention mechanism to perform node representation learning in the HIN.AA-HGNNutilizes an active learning framework to enhance learning performance, especially when facing the paucity of labeled data. An adversarial selector will be trained to query high-value candidates for the active learning framework. When the adversarial active learning is completed,AA-HGNNdetects fake news by classifying news article nodes. Experiments with two real-world fake news datasets show that our model can outperform text-based models and other graph-based models when using less labeled data benefiting from the adversarial active learning. As a model with generalizability,AA-HGNNalso has the ability to be widely used in other node classification-related applications on heterogeneous graphs.

[2101.11208] Statistical guided-waves-based SHM via stochastic non-parametric time series models	Ahmad Amer Fotis Kopsaftopoulos111Corresponding author.	Intelligent Structural Systems Laboratory (ISSL)Department of Mechanical Aerospace and Nuclear EngineeringRensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy NY USAEmail:		Damage detection in active-sensing, guided-waves-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has evolved through multiple eras of development during the past decades. Nevertheless, there still exists a number of challenges facing the current state-of-the-art approaches, both in the industry as well as in research and development, including low damage sensitivity, lack of robustness to uncertainties, need for user-defined thresholds, and non-uniform response across a sensor network. In this work, a novel statistical framework is proposed for active-sensing SHM based on the use of ultrasonic guided waves. This framework is based on stochastic non-parametric time series models and their corresponding statistical properties in order to readily provide healthy confidence bounds and enable accurate and robust damage detection via the use of appropriate statistical decision making tests. Three such methods and corresponding statistical quantities (test statistics) along with decision making schemes are formulated and experimentally assessed via the use of three coupons with different levels of complexity: an Al plate with a growing notch, a Carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) plate with added weights to simulate local damages, and the CFRP panel used in the Open Guided Waves project[1], all fitted with piezoelectric transducers and a pitch-catch configuration. The performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of state-of-the-art time-domain damage indices (DIs). The results demonstrate the increased sensitivity and robustness of the proposed methods, with better tracking capability of damage evolution compared to conventional approaches, even for damage-non-intersecting actuator-sensor paths. In particular, thestatistic emerges as the best damage detection metric compared to conventional DIs, as well as the other proposed statistics. This is attributed to the incorporation of experimental uncertainty in defining thestatistic, which results in a both sensitive and robust approach for damage detection. Overall, the proposed statistical methods exhibit greater damage sensitivity across different components, with enhanced robustness to uncertainty, as well as user-friendly application.	
[2101.11209] Impurity induced quantum chaos for an ultracold bosonic ensemble in a double-well	Jie Chen Kevin Keiler Gao Xianlong Peter Schmelcher	für Optische Quantentechnologien Fachbereich Physik Universität Hamburg Luruper Chaussee 149 22761 Hamburg Germany	jie.chen@physnet.uni-hamburg.de	We demonstrate that an ultracold many-body bosonic ensemble confined in a one-dimensional (1D) double-well (DW) potential can exhibit chaotic dynamics due to the presence of a single impurity. The non-equilibrium dynamics is triggered by a quench of the impurity-Bose interaction and is illustrated via the evolution of the population imbalance for the bosons between the two wells. While the increase of the post-quench interaction strength always facilitates the irregular motion for the bosonic population imbalance, it becomes regular again when the impurity is initially populated in the highly excited states. Such an integrability to chaos (ITC) transition is fully captured by the transient dynamics of the corresponding linear entanglement entropy, whose infinite-time averaged value additionally characterizes the edge of the chaos and implies the existence of an effective Bose-Bose attraction induced by the impurity. In order to elucidate the physical origin for the observed ITC transition, we perform a detailed spectral analysis for the mixture with respect to both the energy spectrum as well as the eigenstates. Specifically, two distinguished spectral behaviors upon a variation of the interspecies interaction strength are observed. While the avoided level-crossings take place in the low-energy spectrum, the energy levels in the high-energy spectrum possess a band-like structure and are equidistant within each band. This leads to a significant delocalization of the low-lying eigenvectors which, in turn, accounts for the chaotic nature of the bosonic dynamics. By contrast, those highly excited states bear a high resemblance to the non-interacting integrable basis, which explains for the recovery of the integrability for the bosonic species. Finally, we discuss the induced Bose-Bose attraction as well as its impact on the bosonic dynamics.

Klein,333Department of Optoelectronics, University Duisburg-Essen, 47057 Duisburg, GermanyMasayuki Fujita,11footnotemark:122footnotemark:2and Tadao Nagatsuma,22footnotemark:2	footnotemark:		We present a paradigm for integrated photonic devices based upon broadband slab-confined collimated beams that are launched with half-Maxwell fisheye lenses. Although it is challenging to match to the low-index focus of the lens whilst maintaining adequate field confinement for a well-defined point source, integrated dielectric slot waveguides prove highly suitable, yielding collimators of 90% efficiency and over one octave bandwidth. Terahertz technology will benefit from such broadband slab-confined beams to replace free-space optics, toward compact, mass-producible systems that do not require manual optical alignment. We present two prototype systems to demonstrate the versatility of this concept, namely a diagonally-set distributed Bragg reflector as frequency-division diplexer for terahertz communications, and an attenuated total reflection-based liquid sensor. Both are enabled by oblique in-slab reflections that are collected at a location other than the originating lens, which is not attainable using ordinary single-mode channel waveguides.	
[2101.11211] Harvest: A Reliable and Energy Efficient Bulk Data Collection Service for Large Scale Wireless Sensor Networks	Vinayak NaikAnish Arora	BITS Pilani Ohio State	anish@cse.ohio-state.edu vinayak@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in	We present a bulk data collection service, Harvest, for energy constrained wireless sensor nodes. To increase spatial reuse and thereby decrease latency, Harvest performs concurrent, pipelined exfiltration from multiple nodes to a base station. To this end, it uses a distance-k coloring of the nodes, notably with a constant number of colors, which yields a TDMA schedule whereby nodes can communicate concurrently with low packet losses due to collision. This coloring is based on a randomized CSMA approach which does not exploit location knowledge. Given a bounded degree of the network, each node waits only Otime to obtain a unique color among its distance-k neighbors, in contrast to the traditional deterministic distributed distance-k vertex coloring wherein each node waits Otime to obtain a color.	
[2101.11212] \FGETHR: Fine-Grained Named Entity Typing via Refinement in Hyperbolic Space	Muhammad Asif Ali,1Yifang Sun,1Bing Li,1Wei Wang,21School of Computer Science and Engineering, UNSW, Australia2The Hong Kong university of Science and Technology, China{muhammadasif.ali, bing.li,	copyright:		Fine-Grained Named Entity Typing (FG-NET) aims at classifying the entity mentions into a wide range of entity types (usually hundreds) depending upon the context. While distant supervision is the most common way to acquire supervised training data, it brings in label noise, as it assigns type labels to the entity mentions irrespective of mentions’ context. In attempts to deal with the label noise, leading research on theFG-NETassumes that the fine-grained entity typing data possesses a euclidean nature, which restraints the ability of the existing models in combating the label noise. Given the fact that the fine-grained type hierarchy exhibits a hierarchical structure, it makes hyperbolic space a natural choice to model theFG-NETdata. In this research, we propose\FGETHR, a novel framework that benefits from the hyperbolic geometry in combination with the graph structures to perform entity typing in a performance-enhanced fashion.\FGETHRinitially uses LSTM networks to encode the mention in relation with its context, later it forms a graph to distill/refine the mention’s encodings in the hyperbolic space. Finally, the refined mention encoding is used for entity typing. Experimentation using different benchmark datasets shows that\FGETHRimproves the performance onFG-NETby up to 3.5% in terms of strict accuracy.

It is found that the quasi-periodic disordered models can be approximated by an ensemble of periodic models. The mobility edges can be determined by the overlaps of the energy bands of these periodic models. We demonstrate that this method provides an efficient way to find out the precise location of mobility edge in qusi-periodic disordered models. Based on this approximate method, we also propose an index to indicate the degree of localization of each eigenstate.

We study the problem of text classification with label noise, and aim to capture this noise through an auxiliary noise model over the classifier. We first assign a probability score to each training sample of having a clean or noisy label, using a two-component beta mixture model fitted on the training losses at an early epoch. Using this, we jointly train the classifier and the noise model through a novel de-noising loss having two components: (i) cross-entropy of the noise model prediction with the input label, and (ii) cross-entropy of the classifier prediction with the input label, weighted by the probability of the sample having a clean label. Our empirical evaluation on two text classification tasks and two types of label noise: random and input-conditional, shows that our approach can improve classification accuracy, and prevent over-fitting to the noise.

[2101.11215] How does an external electric field trigger the Cassie-Baxter-Wenzel wetting transition on a textured surface?	Ke Xiao, Xi Chen, and Chen-Xu Wu	Provincial Key Laboratory for Soft Functional Materials Research Department of Physics College of Physical Science and Technology Xiamen University Xiamen 361005 People’s Republic of China	cxwu@xmu.edu.cn	Understanding the critical condition and mechanism of the droplet wetting transition between Cassie-Baxter state and Wenzel state triggered by an external electric field is of considerable importance because of its numerous applications in industry and engineering. However, such a wetting transition on a patterned surface is still not fully understood, e.g., the effects of electro-wetting number, geometry of the patterned surfaces, and droplet volume on the transition have not been systematically investigated. In this paper, we propose a theoretical model for the Cassie-Baxter-Wenzel wetting transition triggered by applying an external voltage on a droplet placed on a mirco-pillared surface or a porous substrate. It is found that the transition is realized by lowering the energy barrier created by the intermediate composite state considerably, which enables the droplet to cross the energy barrier and complete the transition process. Our calculations also indicate that for fixed droplet volume, the critical electrowetting number (voltage) will increase (decrease) along with the surface roughness for a micro-pillar patterned (porous) surface, and if the surface roughness is fixed, a small droplet tends to ease the critical electrowetting condition for the transition. Besides, three dimensional phase diagrams in terms of electrowetting number, surface roughness, and droplet volume are constructed to illustrate the Cassie-Baxter-Wenzel wetting transition. Our theoretical model can be used to explain the previous experimental results about the Cassie-Baxter-Wenzel wetting transition reported in the literature.	
[2101.11216] PPT: Parsimonious Parser Transfer for Unsupervised Cross-Lingual Adaptation	Kemal KurniawanLea FrermannPhilip SchulzTrevor CohnSchool of Computing and Information Systems, University of MelbourneAmazon	Work done outside Amazon.	lea.frermann@unimelb.edu.au tcohn@unimelb.edu.au phschulz@amazon.com kemal.kurniawan@student.unimelb.edu.au	Cross-lingual transfer is a leading technique for parsing low-resource languages in the absence of explicit supervision. Simple ‘direct transfer’ of a learned model based on a multilingual input encoding has provided a strong benchmark. This paper presents a method for unsupervised cross-lingual transfer that improves over direct transfer systems by using their output as implicit supervision as part of self-training on unlabelled text in the target language. The method assumes minimal resources and provides maximal flexibility by (a) accepting any pre-trained arc-factored dependency parser; (b) assuming no access to source language data; (c) supporting both projective and non-projective parsing; and (d) supporting multi-source transfer. With English as the source language, we show significant improvements over state-of-the-art transfer models on both distant and nearby languages, despite our conceptually simpler approach. We provide analyses of the choice of source languages for multi-source transfer, and the advantage of non-projective parsing. Our code is available online.111https://github.com/kmkurn/ppt-eacl2021

We conducted interviews with professional artists who were collaborating with software developers, learning software development, and building and maintaining software. We found artists were motivated to learn software development for intellectual growth and access to technical communities. Artists valued efficient workflows through skilled manual execution and personal software development, but avoided high-level forms of software automation. Artists identified conflicts between their priorities and those of professional developers and computational art communities, which influenced how they used computational aesthetics in their work. These findings contribute to efforts in systems engineering research to integrate end-user programming and creativity support across software and physical media, suggesting opportunities for artists as collaborators. Artists’ experiences writing software can guide technical implementations of domain-specific representations, and their experiences in interdisciplinary production can aid inclusive community building around computational tools.	visual art | software development | creativity support tools

Understanding the coherent dynamics of microwave driven spins in hBN is of crucial importance for advancing these emerging new technologies. Here, we demonstrate and study the Rabi oscillation and related dynamical phenomena of the negatively charged boron vacancy () spins in hBN. We report on different dynamics of thespins at weak and strong magnetic fields. In the former case the defect behaves like a single electron spin system, while in the latter case it behaves like a multi-spin system exhibiting the multiple-frequency dynamical oscillation like clear beat in Ramsey fringes. We also carry out theoretical simulations for the spin dynamics ofand reveal that the nuclear spins can be driven via the strong electric-nuclear coupling existing incenter, which can be modulated by the magnetic field and microwave field.

To tackle this problem, we derive inspiration from a highly intentional learning system via action: the toddler. Inspired by the toddler’s learning procedure, we design an interactive agent that can learn and store task-agnostic visual representation while exploring and interacting with objects in the virtual environment. Experimental results show that such obtained representation was expandable to various vision tasks such as image classification, object localization, and distance estimation tasks. In specific, the proposed model achieved 100%, 75.1% accuracy and 1.62% relative error, respectively, which is noticeably better than autoencoder-based model (99.7%, 66.1%, 1.95%), and also comparable with those of supervised models (100%, 87.3%, 0.71%).

This often leads to failures in crowded scenes with occlusions. We propose a novel solution to overcome the limitations of this fundamental assumption. Our Multi-Instance Pose Network (MIPNet) allows for predicting multiple 2D pose instances within a given bounding box. We introduce a Multi-Instance Modulation Block (MIMB) that can adaptively modulate channel-wise feature responses for each instance and is parameter efficient. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by evaluating on COCO, CrowdPose, and OCHuman datasets. Specifically, we achieveAP on CrowdPose andAP on OCHuman test sets, a significant improvement ofAP andAP over the prior art, respectively. When using ground truth bounding boxes for inference, MIPNet achieves an improvement ofAP on COCO,AP on CrowdPose, andAP on OCHuman validation sets compared to HRNet. Interestingly, when fewer, high confidence bounding boxes are used, HRNet’s performance degrades (byAP) on OCHuman, whereas MIPNet maintains a relatively stable performance (drop ofAP) for the same inputs.

Automatic localization of those landmarks is highly desirable to improve workflow and reduce interobserver variability. Training a machine learning framework to perform such localization is hindered given the sparse nature of gold standard labels; only few percent of cardiac cine series frames are normally manually labeled for clinical use. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end reciprocal detection and tracking model that is specifically designed to handle the sparse nature of echocardiography labels. The model is trained using few annotated frames across the entire cardiac cine sequence to generate consistent detection and tracking of landmarks, and an adversarial training for the model is proposed to take advantage of these annotated frames. The superiority of the proposed reciprocal model is demonstrated using a series of experiments.	{IEEEkeywords}

Here, CHL of the 2state of W atom is manipulated experimentally through adjusting the emission rate of a resonant fluorescence channel with the assistance of an x-ray thin-film planar cavity. The emission rate is accelerated by a factor linearly proportional to the cavity field amplitude, that can be directly controlled by choosing different cavity modes or changing the angle offset in experiment. This experimental observation is in good agreement with theoretical predictions. It is found that the manipulated resonant fluorescence channel even can dominate the CHL. The controllable CHL realized here will facilitate the nonlinear investigations and modern x-ray scattering techniques in hard x-ray region.

At present, most gait recognition methods use silhouette images to represent a person in each frame. However, silhouette images can lose fine-grained spatial information, and most papers do not regard how to obtain these silhouettes in complex scenes. Furthermore, silhouette images contain not only gait features but also other visual clues that can be recognized. Hence these approaches can not be considered as strict gait recognition.

Zhang David Karger	MIT CSAILCambridge 	jzwang@mit.edu karger@mit.edu axz@cs.uw.edu	Society is showing signs of strong ideological polarization. When pushed to seek perspectives different from their own, people often reject diverse ideas or find them unfathomable. Work has shown that framing controversial issues using the values of the audience can improve understanding of opposing views. In this paper, we present our work designing systems for addressing ideological division through educating U.S. news consumers to engage using a framework of fundamental human values known as Moral Foundations. We design and implement a series of new features that encourage users to challenge their understanding of opposing views, including annotation of moral frames in news articles, discussion of those frames via inline comments, and recommendations based on relevant moral frames. We describe two versions of features—the first covering a suite of ways to interact with moral framing in news, and the second tailored towards collaborative annotation and discussion. We conduct a field evaluation of each design iteration with 71 participants in total over a period of 6-8 days, finding evidence suggesting users learned to re-frame their discourse in moral values of the opposing side. Our work provides several design considerations for building systems to engage with moral framing.	moral framing; social annotation; discussion; online news
[2101.11232] Scalable 𝑊-type entanglement resource in neutral-atom arrays with Rydberg-dressed resonant dipole-dipole interaction	Vladimir M. Stojanović	Institut für Angewandte Physik Technical University of Darmstadt D-64289 Darmstadt Germany		While the Rydberg-blockade regime provides the natural setting for creating-type entanglement with cold neutral atoms, it is demonstrated here that a scalable entanglement resource of this type can even be obtained under completely different physical circumstances. To be more precise, a special instance of twistedstates – namely,-twisted ones – can be engineered in one-dimensional arrays of cold neutral atoms with Rydberg-dressed resonant dipole-dipole interaction. In particular, it is shown here that this is possible even when a (dressed) Rydberg excitation is coupled to the motional degrees of freedom of atoms in their respective, nearly-harmonic optical-dipole microtraps, which are quantized into dispersionless (zero-dimensional) bosons. For a specially chosen (“sweet-spot”) detuning of the off-resonant dressing lasers from the relevant internal atomic transitions, the desired-twistedstate of Rydberg-dressed qubits is the ground state of the effective excitation – boson Hamiltonian of the system in a broad window of the relevant parameters. Being at the same time separated from the other eigenstates by a gap equal to the single-boson energy, thisstate can be prepared using a Rabi-type driving protocol. The corresponding preparation times are independent of the system size and several orders of magnitude shorter than the effective lifetimes of the relevant atomic states.

[2101.11234] Classical simulation of lossy boson sampling using matrix product operators	Changhun Oh Kyungjoo Noh Bill Fefferman Liang Jiang	thanks:		Characterizing the computational advantage from noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is an important task from theoretical and practical perspectives. Here, we numerically investigate the computational power of NISQ devices focusing on boson sampling, one of the well-known promising problems which can exhibit quantum supremacy. We study hardness of lossy boson sampling using matrix product operator (MPO) simulation to address the effect of photon-loss on classical simulability using MPO entanglement entropy (EE), which characterizes a running time of an MPO algorithm. An advantage of MPO simulation over other classical algorithms proposed to date is that its simulation accuracy can be efficiently controlled by increasing an MPO’s bond dimension. Notably, we show by simulating lossy boson sampling using an MPO that as an input photon number grows, its computational cost, or MPO EE, behaves differently depending on a loss-scaling, exhibiting a different feature from that of lossless boson sampling. Especially when an output photon number scales faster than the square root of an input photon number, our study shows an exponential scaling of time complexity for MPO simulation. On the contrary, when an output photon number scales slower than the square root of an input photon number, MPO EE may decrease, indicating that an exponential time complexity might not be necessary.

[2101.11236] Rényi Entropy Dynamics and Lindblad Spectrum for Open Quantum System	Yi-Neng Zhou Liang Mao Hui Zhai	thanks:	hzhai@tsinghua.edu.cn	In this letter we point out that the Lindblad spectrum of a quantum many-body system displays a segment structure and exhibits two different energy scales in the strong dissipation regime. One energy scale determines the separation between different segments, being proportional to the dissipation strength, and the other energy scale determines the broadening of each segment, being inversely proportional to the dissipation strength. Ultilizing a relation between the dynamics of the second Rényi entropy and the Lindblad spectrum, we show that these two energy scales respectively determine the short- and the long-time dynamics of the second Rényi entropy starting from a generic initial state. This gives rise to opposite behaviors, that is, as the dissipation strength increases, the short-time dynamics becomes faster and the long-time dynamics becomes slower. We also interpret the quantum Zeno effect as specific initial states that only occupy the Lindblad spectrum around zero, for which only the broadening energy scale of the Lindblad spectrum matters and gives rise to suppressed dynamics with stronger dissipation. We illustrate our theory with two concrete models that can be experimentally verified.

We find that at the initial stage, the entropy always increases linearly matching the Markovian result. When the system thermalizes with the environment at a sufficiently long time, if the environment temperature is low and the coupling between system and environment is weak, then the total thermal entropy is low and the entanglement between system and environment is also weak, which yields a small system entropy in the long-time steady state. This manifestation of non-Markovian effects of the environment forces the entropy to decrease in the later stage, which yields the Page curve for the entropy dynamics. We argue that this physical scenario revealed by the exact solution of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model is universally applicable for general chaotic quantum many-body systems and can be verified experimentally in near future.

In contrast to most of the existing approaches where the parametric hand models are employed as the prior, we show that the hand mesh can be learned directly from the input image. We propose a new type of GAN called Im2Mesh GAN to learn the mesh through end-to-end adversarial training. By interpreting the mesh as a graph, our model is able to capture the topological relationship among the mesh vertices. We also introduce a 3D surface descriptor into the GAN architecture to further capture the 3D features associated. We experiment two approaches where one can reap the benefits of coupled groundtruth data availability of images and the corresponding meshes, while the other combats the more challenging problem of mesh estimations without the corresponding groundtruth. Through extensive evaluations we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art.	
[2101.11240] Long time dynamics of a single particle extended quantum walk on a one dimensional lattice with complex hoppings: a generalized hydrodynamic description	Hemlata Bhandari P. Durganandini	Department of Physics Savitribai Phule Pune University Pune 411007 India		We study the continuous time quantum walk of a single particle (initially localized at a single site) on a one-dimensional spatial lattice with complex nearest neighbour and next-nearest neighbour hopping amplitudes. Complex couplings lead to chiral propagation and a causal cone structure asymmetric about the origin. We provide a hydrodynamic description for quantum walk dynamics in large space time limit. We find a global ”quasi-stationary state” which can be described in terms of the local quasi-particle densities satisfying Euler type of hydrodynamic equation and is characterized by an infinite set of conservation laws satisfied by scaled cumulative position moments. Further, we show that there is anomalous sub-diffusive scaling near the extremal fronts, which can be described by higher order hydrodynamic equations. The long time behaviour for any complex next-nearest neighbour hopping with a non-zero real component is similar to that of purely real hopping (apart from asymmetric distribution). There is a critical coupling strength at which there is a Lifshitz transition where the topology of the causal structure changes from a regime with one causal cone to a regime with two nested causal cones. On the other hand, for purely imaginary next-nearest neighbour hopping, there is a transition from one causal cone to a regime with two partially overlapping cones due to the existence of degenerate maximal fronts (moving with the same maximal velocity). The nature of the Lifshitz transition and the scaling behaviour (both) at the critical coupling strength is different in the two cases.

First, a novel prescribed performance function is defined to guarantee that the tracking error performance has a small overshoot in the transient process and converges to an arbitrary small region within a predetermined time in the steady-state process without knowing the initial tracking error in advance. Then, based on the novel prescribed performance function, an error transformation combined with the smooth finite-time control method we proposed before is employed to drive the elevation and pitch angles to track given desired trajectories with guaranteed tracking performance. The theoretical analysis of finite-time Lyapunov stability indicates that the closed-loop system is fast finite-time uniformly ultimately boundedness. Finally, comparative experiment results illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.

[2101.11245] Convolutional Neural Network-Based Age Estimation Using B-Mode Ultrasound Tongue Image				Ultrasound tongue imaging is widely used for speech production research, and it has attracted increasing attention as its potential applications seem to be evident in many different fields, such as the visual biofeedback tool for second language acquisition and silent speech interface. Unlike previous studies, here we explore the feasibility of age estimation using the ultrasound tongue image of the speakers. Motivated by the success of deep learning, this paper leverages deep learning on this task. We train a deep convolutional neural network model on the UltraSuite dataset. The deep model achieves mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.03 for the data from typically developing children, while MAE is 4.87 for the data from the children with speech sound disorders, which suggest that age estimation using ultrasound is more challenging for the children with speech sound disorder. The developed method can be used a tool to evaluate the performance of speech therapy sessions. It is also worthwhile to notice that, although we leverage the ultrasound tongue imaging for our study, the proposed methods may also be extended to other imaging modalities (e.g. MRI) to assist the studies on speech production.	
[2101.11246] A Survey on 5G Radio Access Network Energy Efficiency: Massive MIMO, Lean Carrier Design, Sleep Modes, and Machine Learning	David López-Pérez, Antonio De Domenico, Nicola Piovesan, Geng Xinli, Harvey Bao, Song Qitao and Mérouane Debbah			Cellular networks have changed the world we are living in, and the fifth generation (5G) of radio technology is expected to further revolutionise our everyday lives, by enabling a high degree of automation, through its larger capacity, massive connectivity, and ultra-reliable low-latency communications. In addition, the third generation partnership project (3GPP) new radio (NR) specification also provides tools to significantly decrease the energy consumption and the green house emissions of next generations networks, thus contributing towards information and communication technology (ICT) sustainability targets. In this survey paper, we thoroughly review the state-of-the-art on current energy efficiency research. We first categorise and carefully analyse the different power consumption models and energy efficiency metrics, which have helped to make progress on the understanding of green networks. Then, as a main contribution, we survey in detail —from a theoretical and a practical viewpoint— the main energy efficiency enabling technologies that 3GPP NR provides, together with their main benefits and challenges. Special attention is paid to four key enabling technologies, i.e., massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), lean carrier design, and advanced idle modes, together with the role of artificial intelligence capabilities. We dive into their implementation and operational details, and thoroughly discuss their optimal operation points and theoretical-trade-offs from an energy consumption perspective. This will help the reader to grasp the fundamentals of —and the status on— green networking. Finally, the areas of research where more effort is needed to make future networks greener are also discussed.

Li-Hua  WangYin-Jie Zhang	thanks:	songlh@ncst.edu.cn	By globally analyzing nuclear Drell-Yan data including all incident energies, the nuclear effects of nPDFs and initial-state parton energy loss are investigated. Based on Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) regime, the calculations are carried out by means of the analytic parametrizations of quenching weights derived from the Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peign-Schiff (BDMPS) formalism and using the new EPPS16 nPDFs. It is found that the results are in good agreement with the data and the role of the energy loss effect on the suppression of Drell-Yan ratios is prominent, especially for low-mass Drell-Yan measurements. The nuclear effects of nPDFs becomes more obvious with the nuclear mass number A, the same as the energy loss effect. By global fit, the transport coefficient extracted isGeV/fm. In addition, to avoid diminishing the QCD NLO correction on the data form of Drell-Yan ratios, the separate calculations about the Compton differential cross section ratiosat 120GeV are performed, which provides a feasible way to better distinguish the gluon energy loss in Compton scattering. It is found that the role of the initial-state gluon energy loss on the suppression of Compton scattering rations is not very important and becomes disappear with the increase of.

Existing video summarization frameworks are based on algorithms that utilize computer vision low-level feature extraction or high-level domain level extraction. However, being the ultimate user of the summarized video, humans remain the most neglected aspect. Therefore, the proposed paper considers human’s role in summarization and introduces human visual attention-based summarization techniques. To understand human attention behavior, we have designed and performed experiments with human participants using electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking technology. The EEG and eye-tracking data obtained from the experimentation are processed simultaneously and used to segment frames containing useful information from a considerable video volume. Thus, the frame segmentation primarily relies on the cognitive judgments of human beings. Using our approach, a video is summarized by96.5% while maintaining higher precision (0.98) and high recall factors (0.97). The comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques demonstrates that the proposed approach yields ceiling-level performance with reduced computational cost in summarising the videos.

Previous event-based feature extraction methods are mainly focused on corners, which mainly find their locations, however, ignoring the geometrical structure information like orientations and scales of edges. This paper adapts the frame-baseda-contrariojunction detector(ACJ) to event data, proposing the event-baseda-contrariojunction detector(e-ACJ), which yields junctions’ locations while giving the scales and orientations of their branches. The proposed method relies on ana-contrariomodel and can operate on asynchronous events directly without generating synthesized event frames. We evaluate the performance on public event datasets. The result shows our method successfully finds the orientations and scales of branches, while maintaining high accuracy in junction’s location.

VWV and VWT measurements require the lumen-intima (LIB) and media-adventitia boundaries (MAB) at the common and internal carotid arteries (CCA and ICA). However, most existing segmentation techniques were capable of automating only CCA segmentation. An approach capable of segmenting the MAB and LIB from the CCA and ICA was required to accelerate VWV and VWT quantification.

Delineation of Gross Target Volume (GTV) from medical images is a prerequisite for radiotherapy. As manual delineation is time-consuming and laborious, automatic segmentation of GTV has a potential to improve the efficiency of this process. This work aims to automatically segment GTV of nasopharynx cancer from Computed Tomography (CT) images. However, it is challenged by the small target region, anisotropic resolution of clinical CT images, and the low contrast between the target region and surrounding soft tissues. To deal with these problems, we propose a 2.5D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to handle the different in-plane and through-plane resolutions. We also propose a spatial attention module to enable the network to focus on the small target, and use channel attention to further improve the segmentation performance. Moreover, we use a multi-scale sampling method for training so that the networks can learn features at different scales, which are combined with a multi-model ensemble method to improve the robustness of segmentation results. We also estimate the uncertainty of segmentation results based on our model ensemble, which is of great importance for indicating the reliability of automatic segmentation results for radiotherapy planning. Experiments with 2019 MICCAI StructSeg dataset showed that (1) Our proposed 2.5D network has a better performance on images with anisotropic resolution than the commonly used 3D networks. (2) Our attention mechanism can make the network pay more attention to the small GTV region and improve the segmentation accuracy. (3) The proposed multi-scale model ensemble achieves more robust results, and it can simultaneously obtain uncertainty information that can indicate potential mis-segmentations for better clinical decisions.

In our model, the gene drive has a negative effect on the fitness of individuals carrying it, and is therefore susceptible of decreasing the total carrying capacity of the population locally in space. This tends to generate an opposing demographic advection that the gene drive has to overcome in order to invade. While previous reaction–diffusion models neglected this aspect, here we focus on it and try to predict the sign of the traveling wave speed. It turns out to be an analytical challenge, only partial results being within reach, and we complete our theoretical analysis by numerical simulations. Our results indicate that taking into account the interplay between population dynamics and population genetics might actually be crucial, as it can effectively reverse the direction of the invasion and lead to failure. Our findings can be extended to other bistable systems, such as the spread of cytoplasmic incompatibilities caused by Wolbachia.

Cyr2			Approximation theorists have established best-in-class optimal approximation rates of deep neural networks by utilizing their ability to simultaneously emulate partitions of unity and monomials. Motivated by this, we propose partition of unity networks (POUnets) which incorporate these elements directly into the architecture. Classification architecturesof the type used to learnprobability measures are used to build a meshfree partition of space, while polynomial spaces with learnable coefficients areassociatedto each partition. The resulting-element-like approximation allows use of a fast least-squares optimizer, and the resulting architecture sizeneednot scale exponentially with spatial dimension, breaking the curse of dimensionality. An abstract approximation result establishes desirable properties to guide network design. Numerical results for two choices of architecture demonstratethat POUnets yield-convergence for smooth functions and consistently outperform MLPs for piecewise polynomial functions with large numbers of discontinuities.

We have recently witnessed impressive results in specific data integration tasks, such as Entity Resolution, thanks to the increasing availability of benchmarks. A limitation of such benchmarks is that they typically come with their own task definition and it can be difficult to leverage them for complex integration pipelines. As a result, evaluating end-to-end pipelines for the entire data integration process is still an elusive goal. In this work, we present Alaska, the first benchmark based on real-world dataset to support seamlessly multiple tasks (and their variants) of the data integration pipeline. The dataset consists of 70k heterogeneous product specifications from 71 e-commerce websites with thousands of different product attributes. Our benchmark comes with profiling meta-data, a set of pre-defined use cases with diverse characteristics, and an extensive manually curated ground truth. We demonstrate the flexibility of our benchmark by focusing on several variants of two crucial data integration tasks,Schema MatchingandEntity Resolution. Our experiments show that our benchmark enables the evaluation of a variety of methods that previously were difficult to compare, and can foster the design of more holistic data integration solutions.

Chanteau	Nataša VodopivecUniv Grenoble-AlpesGrenoble INP Carole AdamUniv Grenoble-AlpesGrenoble Informatics Lab Jean-Pierre ChanteauUniv Grenoble-AlpesCentre de Recherche en Economie de Grenoble			The diffusion of innovations is an important topic for the consumer markets. Early research focused on how innovations spread on the level of the whole society. To get closer to the real world scenarios agent based models (ABM) started focusing on individual-level agents. In our work we will translate an existing ABM that investigates the role of opinion leaders in the process of diffusion of innovations to a new, more expressive platform designed for agent based modeling. We will do it to show that taking advantage of new features of the chosen platform should be encouraged when making models in the field of social sciences in the future, because it can be beneficial for the explanatory power of simulation results.

[2101.11264] Characteristic classes for TC structures	Mauricio Cepeda Davila			In this article we study the construction of characteristic classes for principal-bundles equipped with an additional structure called transitionally commutative structure (TC structure). These structures classify, up to homotopy, possible trivializations of a principal-bundle, such that the induced cocycle have functions that commute in the intersections of their domains. We focus mainly on the cases where the structural group G equals SU(n), U(n) or Sp(n). Our approach is an algebraic-geometric construction that relies on the so called power maps defined on the space, the classifying space for commutativity in the group G.

The taxonomy expansion task aims to find a position for a new term in an existing taxonomy to capture the emerging knowledge in the world and keep the taxonomy dynamically updated. Previous taxonomy expansion solutions neglect valuable information brought by the hierarchical structure and evaluate the correctness of merely an added edge, which downgrade the problem to node-pair scoring or mini-path classification. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchy Expansion Framework (HEF), which fully exploits the hierarchical structure’s properties to maximize the coherence of expanded taxonomy.HEFmakes use of taxonomy’s hierarchical structure in multiple aspects: i)HEFutilizes subtrees containing most relevant nodes as self-supervision data for a complete comparison of parental and sibling relations; ii)HEFadopts a coherence modeling module to evaluate the coherence of a taxonomy’s subtree by integrating hypernymy relation detection and several tree-exclusive features; iii)HEFintroduces the Fitting Score for position selection, which explicitly evaluates both path and level selections and takes full advantage of parental relations to interchange information for disambiguation and self-correction. Extensive experiments show that by better exploiting the hierarchical structure and optimizing taxonomy’s coherence,HEFvastly surpasses the prior state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets by an average improvement of 46.7% in accuracy and 32.3% in mean reciprocal rank.	taxonomy expansion | self-supervised learning | hierarchical structure

In the classic model, it is assumed that all nodes have the same weight. We study voting protocols for heterogeneous weights with respect to fairness. A voting protocol isfairif the influence on the eventual outcome of a given participant is linear in its weight. Previous work used sampling with replacement to construct a fair voting scheme. However, it was shown that using greedy sampling, i.e., sampling with replacement until a given number of distinct elements is chosen, turns out to be more robust and performant.

The-samples along a baseline track are aggregated into a bin until a specified decorrelation tolerance is exceeded. The degree of decorrelation in the bin correspondingly determines the amount of channel and timeslot averaging that is suitable for samples in the bin. This necessarily implies that the number of channels and timeslots varies per bin and the output data loses the rectilinear input shape of the input data.

The authors of ref.[WohlmanAharony,] first propose an ansatz for the wave function in the spin active region and go on to show that the resulting transmission does not show spin dependence, reasoning that spin dependence would violate Bardarson’s assertion. Here we clearly show that the ansatz presented assumes spin-momentum independence from the outset and thus just addresses the spinless particle problem. We then find the appropriate eigenfunction contemplating spin-momentum coupling and show that the resulting spectrum obeys Bardarson’s theorem. Finally we show that the allowed wavevectors are the ones assumed in the original paper and thus the original conclusions follow. We recognize that the Hamiltonian in our paper written in local coordinates on a helix was deceptively simple and offer the expressions of how it should be written to more overtly convey the physics involved. The relation between spin polarization and torque becomes clear, as described in reference ref.[VarelaZambrano,]. This response is a very important clarification in relation to the implications of Bardarson’s theorem concerning the possibility of spin polarization in one dimensional systems in the linear regime.	
[2101.11272] VisualMRC: Machine Reading Comprehension on Document Images	Ryota Tanaka, Kyosuke Nishida11footnotemark:1, Sen Yoshida	footnotemark:		Recent studies on machine reading comprehension have focused on text-level understanding but have not yet reached the level of human understanding of the visual layout and content of real-world documents. In this study, we introduce a new visual machine reading comprehension dataset, named VisualMRC, wherein given a question and a document image, a machine reads and comprehends texts in the image to answer the question in natural language. Compared with existing visual question answering (VQA) datasets that contain texts in images, VisualMRC focuses more on developing natural language understanding and generation abilities. It contains 30,000+ pairs of a question and an abstractive answer for 10,000+ document images sourced from multiple domains of webpages. We also introduce a new model that extends existing sequence-to-sequence models, pre-trained with large-scale text corpora, to take into account the visual layout and content of documents. Experiments with VisualMRC show that this model outperformed the base sequence-to-sequence models and a state-of-the-art VQA model. However, its performance is still below that of humans on most automatic evaluation metrics. The dataset will facilitate research aimed at connecting vision and language understanding.

The far-infrared to far-ultraviolet spectral energy distributions of 85 AGNs are reproduced with the latest version of Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE), where the AGN clumpy torus modelSKIRTORis implemented. Most of their hosts are confirmed to be main sequence star-forming galaxies. We find that the mean ratio of the black hole mass () to the total stellar mass () is, which is similar to the local black hole-to-bulge mass ratio. This suggests that if the host galaxies of these moderately luminous AGNs atare dominated by bulges, they already established the local black hole mass-bulge mass relation; if they are disk dominant, their black holes are overmassive relative to the bulges. AGN bolometric luminosities and SFR show a good correlation with ratios higher than that expected from the local black hole-to-bulge mass relation, suggesting that these AGNs are in a SMBH-growth dominant phase.

The-pair approximation without significant renormalization, on the other hand, cannot describe the full SU(3) collectivity.

However, this adjustment only varies with the current iteration number, and lacks of flexibility and variety which makes a poor search efficiency and robustness of BSO. To alleviate this problem, an adaptive step length structure together with a success memory selection strategy are proposed to be incorporated into BSO. This proposed method, adaptive step length based on memory selection BSO, namely ASBSO, applies multiple step lengths to modify the generation process of new solutions, thus supplying a flexible search according to corresponding problems and convergent periods. The novel memory mechanism which is capable of evaluating and storing the degree of improvements of solutions is used to determine the selection possibility of step lengths. A set of 57 benchmark functions are used to test ASBSO’s search ability, and four real-world problems are adopted to show its application value. All these test results indicate the remarkable improvement in solution quality, scalability and robustness of ASBSO.

This instrument is developed to map the magnetic field, and to track a dipolar magnetic source in the presence of a static homogeneous field. The position and orientation of the magnetic source with respect to the sensor frame is retrieved together with the orientation of the frame with respect to the environmental field. A nonlinear best-fit procedure is used, and its precision, time performance, and reliability are analyzed. This analysis is performed in view of the practical application for which the system is designed that is an eye-tracking diagnostics and rehabilitative tool for medical purposes, which require high speed (Sa/s) and sub-millimetric spatial resolution.

[2101.11277] Cooperative success in epithelial public goods games	Jessie Renton Karen M. PageDepartment of Mathematics, University College London,Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, UK	Corresponding author:	jessica.renton.16@ucl.ac.uk	Cancer cells obtain mutations which rely on the production of diffusible growth factors to confer a fitness benefit. These mutations can be considered cooperative, and studied as public goods games within the framework of evolutionary game theory. The population structure, benefit function and update rule all influence the evolutionary success of cooperators. We model the evolution of cooperation in epithelial cells using the Voronoi tessellation model. Unlike traditional evolutionary graph theory, this allows us to implement global updating, for which birth and death events are spatially decoupled. We compare, for a sigmoid benefit function, the conditions for cooperation to be favoured and/or beneficial for well-mixed and structured populations. We find that when population structure is combined with global updating, cooperation is more successful than if there were local updating or the population were well-mixed. Interestingly, the qualitative behaviour for the well-mixed population and the Voronoi tessellation model is remarkably similar, but the latter case requires significantly lower incentives to ensure cooperation.

Sorbonne UniversitéParisFrance		Haptic feedback has become crucial to enhance the user experiences in Virtual Reality (VR). This justifies the sudden burst of novel haptic solutions proposed these past years in the HCI community. This article is a survey of Virtual Reality interactions, relying on haptic devices. We propose two dimensions to describe and compare the current haptic solutions: their degree of physicality, as well as their degree of actuation. We depict a compromise between the user and the designer, highlighting how the range of required or proposed stimulation in VR is opposed to the haptic interfaces flexibility and their deployment in real-life use-cases. This paper (1) outlines the variety of haptic solutions and provides a novel perspective for analysing their associated interactions, (2) highlights the limits of the current evaluation criteria regarding these interactions, and finally (3) reflects the interaction, operation and conception potentials of ”encountered-type of haptic devices”.	haptics | Virtual Reality | human factors | haptic devices

We find the external modulation of different intensity states through the test, required in those TF-QKD with post-phase compensation, shows a side channel in frequency domain. Based on this, we propose a complete and undetected eavesdropping attack, named passive frequency shift attack, on sending or not-sending (SNS) TF-QKD protocol given any difference between signal and decoy states in frequency domain which can be extended to other imperfections with distinguishable decoy states. We analyze this attack by giving the formula of upper bound of real secure key rate and comparing it with lower bound of secret key rate under Alice and Bob’s estimation with the consideration of actively odd-parity pairing (AOPP) method and finite key effects. The simulation results show that Eve can get full information about the secret key bits without being detected at long distance. Our results emphasize the importance of practical security at source and might provide a valuable reference for the practical implementation of TF-QKD.

We seek to generalize and enrich the anticentre to the context of supersymmetric pairs, or more generally supersymmetric spaces. We define certain invariant distributions on, which we call ghost distributions, and which in some sense are induced from invariant distributions on. Ghost distributions, and in particular their Harish-Chandra polynomials, give information about branching fromto a symmetric subgroupwhich is related (and sometimes conjugate) to. We discuss the case offor an arbitrary quasireductive supergroup, where our results prove the existence of a polynomial which determines projectivity of irreducible-modules. Finally, a generalization of Gorelik’s ghost centre is defined which we call the full ghost centre,.

Previous upper bound states thatnestings is sufficient for GHH to achieve universal representation power, but the corresponding lower bound was unknown. We prove thatnestings is necessary for universal representation power, which provides an almost tight lower bound. We also show that one-hidden-layer neural networks don’t have universal approximation power over the whole domain. The analysis is based on a key lemma showing that any finite sum of periodic functions is either non-integrable or the zero function, which might be of independent interest.

Based on hypotheses derived from linguistic theory, we investigate whether language models adhere to learning principles of multi-task learning during training. To showcase the idea, we analyse the generalisation behaviour of language models as they learn the linguistic concept of Negative Polarity Items (NPIs). Our experiments demonstrate that a multi-task setting naturally emergeswithinthe objective of the more general task of language modelling. We argue that this insight is valuable for multi-task learning, linguistics and interpretability research and can lead to exciting new findings in all three domains.

The bandwidth is divided intoorthogonal channels, andusers aim to access the spectrum. Each user chooses a single channel for transmission at each time slot. The state of each channel is modeled by a restless unknown Markovian process. Previous studies have analyzed a special case of this setting, in which each channel yields the same expected rate for all users. By contrast, we consider a more general and practical model, where each channel yields a different expected rate for each user. This model adds a significant challenge of how to efficiently learn a channel allocation in a distributed manner to yield a global system-wide objective. We adopt the stable matching utility as the system objective, which is known to yield strong performance in multichannel wireless networks, and develop a novel Distributed Stable Strategy Learning (DSSL) algorithm to achieve the objective. We prove theoretically that DSSL converges to the stable matching allocation, and the regret, defined as the loss in total rate with respect to the stable matching solution, has a logarithmic order with time. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the strong performance of the DSSL algorithm.

A test is an action on a subset of items which returns positive if the subset contains at least one positive and negative otherwise. In non-adaptive group testing, all tests are fixed in advance and can be performed in parallel. In this work, we consider non-adaptive group testing with consecutive positives in which the items are linearly ordered and the positives are consecutive in that order.

HospedalesCollege of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, ChinaSchool of Informatics, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UKSamsung AI Centre, Cambridge	footnotetext:	liyiying10@nudt.edu.cn	Federated learning (FL) enables distributed participants to collectively learn a strong global model without sacrificing their individual data privacy. Mainstream FL approaches require each participant to share a common network architecture and further assume that data are are sampled IID across participants. However, in real-world deployments participants may require heterogeneous network architectures; and the data distribution is almost certainly non-uniform. To address these issues we introduce FedH2L, which is agnostic to the model architecture and robust to different data distributions across participants. In contrast to approaches sharing parameters or gradients, FedH2L relies on mutual distillation, exchanging only posteriors on a shared seed set between participants in a decentralized manner. This makes it extremely bandwidth efficient, model agnostic, and crucially produces models capable of performing well on the whole data distribution when learning from heterogeneous silos.

[2101.11298] How to Evaluate a Summarizer: Study Design and Statistical Analysis for Manual Linguistic Quality Evaluation	Julius Steen Katja MarkertDepartment of Computational LinguisticsHeidelberg University69120 Heidelberg,			Manual evaluation is essential to judge progress on automatic text summarization. However, we conduct a survey on recent summarization system papers that reveals little agreement on how to perform such evaluation studies. We conduct two evaluation experiments on two aspects of summaries’ linguistic quality (coherence and repetitiveness) to compare Likert-type and ranking annotations and show that best choice of evaluation method can vary from one aspect to another. In our survey, we also find that study parameters such as the overall number of annotators and distribution of annotators to annotation items are often not fully reported and that subsequent statistical analysis ignores grouping factors arising from one annotator judging multiple summaries. Using our evaluation experiments, we show that the total number of annotators can have a strong impact on study power and that current statistical analysis methods can inflate type I error rates up to eight-fold. In addition, we highlight that for the purpose of system comparison the current practice of eliciting multiple judgements per summary leads to less powerful and reliable annotations given a fixed study budget.	
[2101.11299] Edge-Labeling based Directed Gated Graph Network for Few-shot Learning				Existing graph-network-based few-shot learning methods obtain similarity between nodes through a convolution neural network (CNN). However, the CNN is designed for image data with spatial information rather than vector form node feature. In this paper, we proposed an edge-labeling-based directed gated graph network (DGGN) for few-shot learning, which utilizes gated recurrent units to implicitly update the similarity between nodes. DGGN is composed of a gated node aggregation module and an improved gated recurrent unit (GRU) based edge update module. Specifically, the node update module adopts a gate mechanism using activation of edge feature, making a learnable node aggregation process. Besides, improved GRU cells are employed in the edge update procedure to compute the similarity between nodes. Further, this mechanism is beneficial to gradient backpropagation through the GRU sequence across layers. Experiment results conducted on two benchmark datasets show that our DGGN achieves a comparable performance to the-state-of-art methods.

College King’s Parade Cambridge CB2 1ST.	grw44@cam.ac.uk heh1@cam.ac.uk	We study the dynamics of proppants carried by fluid driven into an evolving penny-shaped fracture. The behaviour of the slurry flow is investigated in two phases: pressurised injection and elastic closure. During injection the slurry is modelled using a frictional rheology that takes into account the shear-induced migration and jamming of the proppants. Making pragmatic assumptions of negligible toughness and cross-fracture fluid slip, we find self-similar solutions supporting a range of proppant concentration profiles. In particular, we define an effective viscosity, which equates the fracture evolution of a slurry flow with a given proppant volume fraction, to a Newtonian flow with a particular viscosity. Using this framework, we are able to make predictions about the geometry of the growing fracture and the significance of tip screen-out. In the closure phase, proppants are modelled as incompressible and radially immobile within the narrowing fracture. The effects of proppant concentration on the geometry of the residual propped fracture are explored in full. The results have important applications to industrial fracking and geological dike formation by hot, intruding magma.

In this work, we propose a meta-learning approach to document classification in a limited-resource setting and demonstrate its effectiveness in two different settings: few-shot, cross-lingual adaptation to previously unseen languages; and multilingual joint training when limited target-language data is available during training. We conduct a systematic comparison of several meta-learning methods, investigate multiple settings in terms of data availability and show that meta-learning thrives in settings with a heterogeneous task distribution. We propose a simple, yet effective adjustment to existing meta-learning methods which allows for better and more stable learning, and set a new state of the art on several languages while performing on-par on others, using only a small amount of labeled data.

E-mail: received April 2021; revised …		Formal methods and supporting tools have a long record of successes in the development of safety-critical systems. However, no single tool has emerged as the dominant solution for system design. Each tool differs from the others in terms of the modeling language used, its verification capabilities and other complementary features, and each development context has peculiar needs that require different tools. This is particularly problematic for the railway industry, in which formal methods are highly recommended by the norms, but no actual guidance is provided for the selection of tools. To guide companies in the selection of the most appropriate formal tools to adopt in their contexts, a clear assessment of the features of the currently available tools is required.

Previous work has shown that such metrics admit an asymptotic expansion near each puncture, allowing one to define an asymptotic necksize of each singular point. We prove that any set in the moduli space such that the distances between distinct punctures and the asymptotic necksizes all remain bounded away from zero is sequentially compact, mirroring a theorem of D. Pollack about singular Yamabe metrics. Along the way we define a radial Pohozaev invariant at each puncture and refine somea prioribounds of the conformal factor, which may be of independent interest.

[2101.11306] Learnable Non-linear Wavelet Transformation via Normalizing Flow	Shuo-Hui Li			Wavelet transformation stands as a cornerstone in modern data analysis and signal processing. Its mathematical essence is an invertible transformation that discerns slow patterns from fast ones in the frequency domain. Such an invertible transformation can be learned by a designed normalizing flow model. With a generalized lifting scheme as coupling layers, a factor-out layer resembling the downsampling, and parameter sharing at different levels of the model, one can train the normalizing flow to filter high-frequency elements at different levels, thus extending traditional linear wavelet transformations to learnable non-linear deep learning models. In this paper, a way of building such flow is proposed, along with a numerical analysis of the learned transformation. Then, we demonstrate the model’s ability in image lossless compression, show it can achieve SOTA compression scores while achieving a small model size, substantial generalization ability, and the ability to handle high-dimensional data.

Williams	institutetext:	esanchis@eso.org	We perform a comprehensive demographic study of the CO extent relative to dust of the disk population in the Lupus clouds, in order to find indications of dust evolution and possible correlations with other disk properties. We increase up to 42 the number of disks of the region with measuredandfrom observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), based on the gas emission in therotational transition and large dust grains emission atmm. The CO integrated emission map is modeled with an elliptical Gaussian or Nuker function, depending on the quantified residuals; the continuum is fitted to a Nuker profile from interferometric modeling. The CO and dust sizes, namely, the radii enclosing a certain fraction of the respective total flux (e.g.,) are inferred from the modeling. The CO emission is more extended than the dust continuum, with a/median value of 2.5, for the entire population and for a sub-sample with high completeness. 6 disks, aroundof the Lupus disk population have a size ratio above 4. Based on thermo-chemical modeling, this value can only be explained if the disk has undergone grain growth and radial drift. These disks do not have unusual properties, spreading across the disk population’s ranges of stellar mass (), disk mass (), CO and dust sizes (,), and mass accretion of the entire population. We search for correlations between the size ratio and,,and: only a weak monotonic anti-correlation with theis found, this would imply that dust evolution is more prominent in more compact dusty disks. The lack of strong correlations is remarkable: the sample covers a wide range of stellar and disk properties, and the majority of the disks have very similar size ratios. This result suggests that the bulk of the disk population may have a similar behavior and evolutionary stage, independent of the stellar and disk properties. These results should be further investigated, since the optical depth difference between CO and dust continuum might play a major role in the observed size ratios of the population. Lastly, we find a monotonic correlation between the CO flux and the CO size. The results for the majority of the disks are consistent with optically thick emission and an average CO temperature of around 30 K, however, the exact value of the temperature is difficult to constrain.

By leveraging the semantics of the observed signals, all sensors measuring the same event share the same codebook (with non-orthogonal codewords), and all such sensors making the same local estimate of the event transmit the same codeword.

Adversarial stylometry intends to attack such models by rewriting an author’s text. Our research proposes several components to facilitate deployment of these adversarial attacks in the wild, where neither data nor target models are accessible. We introduce a transformer-based extension of a lexical replacement attack, and show it achieves high transferability when trained on a weakly labeled corpus—decreasing target model performance below chance. While not completely inconspicuous, our more successful attacks also prove notably less detectable by humans. Our framework therefore provides a promising direction for future privacy-preserving adversarial attacks.

Another issue concerning high-velocity targets is related to the loss in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after performingrange compression. In particular, this loss can be partially mitigated by the use of subpulse processing (SP). Modern radars combine these techniques in order to reliably unfold the target velocity. However, the presence of background noise may compromise the Doppler estimates. Hence, a rigorous statistical analysis is imperative. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis on Doppler estimation. In particular, we derive novel closed-form expressions for the probability of detection (PD) and probability of false alarm (PFA). To this end, we consider the newly introduce SP along with the CCRT. A comparison analysis between SP and the classic pulse processing (PP) technique is also carried out. Numerical results and Monte-Carlo simulations corroborate the validity of our expressions and show that the SP–plus–CCRT technique helps to greatly reduce the PFA compared to previous studies, thereby improving radar detection.

This gives rise to new states where quantum fluctuations of light and matter can alter the properties of the material altogether. Here we demonstrate, based on first principles calculations, that such light-matter coupling induces a change of the collective phase from quantum paraelectric to ferroelectric in the SrTiOgroundstate, which has thus far only been achieved in out-of-equilibrium strongly excited conditionsLi2019;Nova2019. This is a light-matter-hybrid groundstate which can only exist because of the coupling to the vacuum fluctuations of light, aphoto-groundstate. The phase transition is accompanied by changes in the crystal structure, showing that fundamental groundstate properties of materials can be controlled via strong light-matter coupling. Such a control of quantum states enables the tailoring of materials properties or even the design of novel materials purely by exposing them to confined light.

Here, we present an ultra-violet imaging study of the nearby flocculent spiral galaxy NGC 7793, observed with the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT). We find that the disk scale-length estimated in Far-UV (2.640.16 kpc) is larger than that in Near-UV (2.210.21 kpc) and optical (1.08 kpc), which supports the inside-out growth scenario of the galaxy disk. The star-forming UV disk is also found to be contained within the extent of H I gas of column density greater thancm. With the spatial resolution of UVIT (1 pixel6.8 pc), we identified 2046 young star-forming clumps in the galaxy with radii between12 - 70 pc, which matches well with the size of GMCs detected in the galaxy. Around 61% of the regions identified in our study have age younger than 20 Myr, which points to a recent enhancement of star formation across the galaxy. We also noticed that the youngest star-forming regions, with age10 Myr, distinctly trace the flocculent arms of the galaxy. The estimated mass of the clumps cover a range between. We noticed a gradient in the mass distribution of identified clumps along the spiral arms. We have also studied the nuclear star cluster of the galaxy and found that the stellar populations in the cluster outskirts are younger than the inner part.	galaxies: spiral – galaxies: individual – galaxies: star formation
[2101.11315] Towards a Standard Feature Set for Network Intrusion Detection System Datasets	Mohanad Sarhan Siamak Layeghy Marius Portmann	institutetext:	siamak.layeghy@uq.net.au marius@ieee.org m.sarhan@uq.net.au	Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are important tools for the protection of computer networks against increasingly frequent and sophisticated cyber attacks. Recently, a lot of research effort has been dedicated to the development of Machine Learning (ML) based NIDSs. As in any ML-based application, the availability of high-quality datasets is critical for the training and evaluation of ML-based NIDS. One of the key problems with the currently available NIDS datasets is the lack of a standard feature set. The use of a unique and proprietary set of features for each of the publicly available datasets makes it virtually impossible to compare the performance of ML-based traffic classifiers on different datasets, and hence to evaluate the ability of these systems to generalise across different network scenarios. To address that limitation, this paper proposes and evaluates standard NIDS feature sets based on the NetFlow network meta-data collection protocol and system. We evaluate and compare two NetFlow-based feature set variants, a version with 12 features, and another one with 43 features. For our evaluation, we converted four widely used NIDS datasets (UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, ToN-IoT, CSE-CIC-IDS2018) into new variants with our proposed NetFlow based feature sets. Based on an Extra Tree classifier, we compared the classification performance of the NetFlow-based feature sets with the proprietary feature sets provided with the original datasets. While the smaller feature set cannot match the classification performance of the proprietary feature sets, the larger set with 43 NetFlow features, surprisingly achieves a consistently higher classification performance compared to the original feature set, which was tailored to each of the considered NIDS datasets. The proposed NetFlow-based standard NIDS feature set, together with four benchmark datasets, made available to the research community, allow a fair comparison of ML-based network traffic classifiers across different NIDS datasets. We believe that having a standard feature set is critical for allowing a more rigorous and thorough evaluation of ML-based NIDSs and that it can help bridge the gap between academic research and the practical deployment of such systems.

In this work, we investigate a novel application of RSMA for joint communications and jamming with a Multi-Carrier (MC) waveform in Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC). Our aim is to simultaneously communicate with Information Users (IU) and jam Adversarial Users (AU) to disrupt their communications in a setting where all users perform broadband communications by MC waveforms in their respective networks. We consider the practical setting of imperfect CSI at transmitter (CSIT) for the IUs and statistical CSIT for AUs. The optimal information and jamming precoders are designed to maximize the sum-rate under jamming power constraints on the pilot subcarriers of AUs, a jamming method considered to be among the most destructive methods for MC waveforms under the considered system model. We compare the sum-rate performance of RSMA and Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) schemes by numerical results to demonstrate that RSMA achieves a significant sum-rate gain compared to SDMA.

[2101.11322] FSI - Vibrations of immersed cylinders. Simulations with the engineering open-source code TrioCFD. Test cases and experimental comparisons	Domenico Panunzio Maria Adela Puscas Romain Lagrange	Den-Service d’Etudes Mécaniques et Thermiques (SEMT) CEA Université Paris-Saclay F-91191 Gif-sur-Yvette France	20romain.lagrange@cea.fr romain.lagrange@cea.fr	In this paper, we assess the capabilities of the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method implemented in the open-source code TrioCFD to tackle down two fluid-structure interaction problems involving moving boundaries. To test the code, we first consider the bi-dimensional case of two coaxial cylinders moving in a viscous fluid. We show that the two fluid forces acting on the cylinders are in phase opposition, with amplitude and phase that only depend on the Stokes number, the dimensionless separation distance and the Keulegan-Carpenter number. Throughout a detailed parametric study, we show that the self (resp. cross) added mass and damping coefficients decrease (resp. increase) with the Stokes number and the separation distance. Our numerical results are in perfect agreement with the theoretical predictions of the literature, thereby validating the robustness of the ALE method implemented in TrioCFD. Then, we challenge the code by considering the case of a vibrating cylinder located in the central position of a square tube bundle. In parallel to the numerical investigations, we also present a new experimental setup for the measurement of the added coefficient, using the direct method introduced by Tanaka. The numerical predictions for the self-added coefficients are shown to be in very good agreement with a theoretical estimation used as a reference by engineers. A good agreement with the experimental results is also obtained for moderate and large Stokes numbers, whereas an important deviation due to parasitic frequencies in the experimental setup appears for low Stokes number. Still, this study clearly confirms that the ALE method implemented in TrioCFD is particularly efficient in solving fluid-structure interaction problems. As an open-source code, and given its ease of use and its flexibility, we believe that TrioCFD is thus perfectly adapted to engineers who need simple numerical tools to tackle down complex industrial problems.

[2101.11323] Universal relations between atomic dipolar relaxation and van der Waals interaction	Yuan-Gang Deng Yi-Quan Zou Gao-Ren Wang Qi Liu Su Yi Meng Khoon Tey Li You	thanks:	syi@itp.ac.cn lyou@tsinghua.edu.cn mengkhoon_tey@tsinghua.edu.cn	Dipolar relaxation happens when one or both colliding atoms flip their spins exothermically inside a magnetic () field. This work reports precise measurements of dipolar relaxation in a Bose-Einstein condensate of ground stateRb atoms together with in-depth theoretical investigations. Previous perturbative treatments fail to explain our observations except at very small-fields. By employing quantum defect theory based on analytic solutions of asymptotic van der Waals interaction(being interatomic spacing), we significantly expand the applicable range of perturbative treatment. We find the-dependent dipolar relaxation lineshapes are largely universal, determined by the coefficientand the associated-wave scattering lengthsof the states before and after spin flips. This universality, which applies generally to other atomic species as well, implicates potential controls of dipolar relaxation and related cold chemical reactions by tuning.	
[2101.11324] Minimum energy with infinite horizon: from stationary to non-stationary states	P. Acquistapace111Dipartimento di Matematica, Università di Pisa, e-mail:  F.Gozzi222Dipartimento di Economia e Finanza, UniversitàLUISS - Guido CarliRoma; e-mail:		fgozzi@luiss.it paolo.acquistapace@unipi.it	We study a non standard infinite horizon, infinite dimensional linear-quadratic control problem arising in the physics of non-stationary states (see e.g.[7,9]): finding the minimum energy to drive a given stationary state(at time) into an arbitrary non-stationary state(at time). This is the opposite to what is commonly studied in the literature on null controllability (where one drives a generic stateinto the equilibrium state). Consequently, the Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) associated to this problem is non-standard since the sign of the linear part is opposite to the usual one and since it is intrinsically unbounded. Hence the standard theory of AREs does not apply. The analogous finite horizon problem has been studied in the companion paper[1]. Here, similarly to such paper, we prove that the linear selfadjoint operator associated to the value function is a solution of the above mentioned ARE. Moreover, differently to[1], we prove that such solution is the maximal one. The first main result (Theorem4.7) is proved by approximating the problem with suitable auxiliary finite horizon problems (which are different from the one studied in[1]). Finally in the special case where the involved operators commute we characterize all solutions of the ARE (Theorem5.5) and we apply this to the Landau-Ginzburg model.	
[2101.11325] Echo State Network for two-dimensional turbulent moist Rayleigh-Bénard convection	Florian Heyder Jörg Schumacher	Institut für Thermo- und Fluiddynamik Technische Universität Ilmenau Postfach 100565 D-98684 Ilmenau Germany		Recurrent neural networks are machine learning algorithms which are suited well to predict time series. Echo state networks are one specific implementation of such neural networks that can describe the evolution of dynamical systems by supervised machine learning without solving the underlying nonlinear mathematical equations. In this work, we apply an echo state network to approximate the evolution of two-dimensional moist Rayleigh-Bénard convection and the resulting low-order turbulence statistics. We conduct long-term direct numerical simulations in order to obtain training and test data for the algorithm. Both sets are pre-processed by a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) using the snapshot method to reduce the amount of data. Training data comprise long time series of the first 150 most energetic POD coefficients. The reservoir is subsequently fed by these data and predicts of future flow states. The predictions are thoroughly validated by original simulations. Our results show good agreement of the low-order statistics. This incorporates also derived statistical moments such as the cloud cover close to the top of the convection layer and the flux of liquid water across the domain. We conclude that our model is capable of learning complex dynamics which is introduced here by the tight interaction of turbulence with the nonlinear thermodynamics of phase changes between vapor and liquid water. Our work opens new ways for thedynamicparametrization of subgrid-scale transport in larger-scale circulation models.

With the improvement in device performance and the accuracy of automatic speech recognition (ASR), real-time captioning is becoming an important tool for helping DHH people in their daily lives. To realize higher-quality communication and overcome the limitations of mobile and augmented-reality devices, real-time captioning that can be used comfortably while maintaining nonverbal communication and preventing incorrect recognition is required. Therefore, we propose a real-time captioning system that uses a transparent display. In this system, the captions are presented on both sides of the display to address the problem of incorrect ASR, and the highly transparent display makes it possible to see both the body language and the captions.	
[2101.11327] Active Brownian Motion with Directional Reversals	Ion Santra Urna Basu Sanjib Sabhapandit	Raman Research Institute Bengaluru 560080 India		Active Brownian motion with intermittent direction reversals are common in a class of bacteria likeMyxococcus xanthusandPseudomonas putida. We show that, for such a motion in two dimensions, the presence of the two time scales set by the rotational diffusion constantand the reversal rategives rise to four distinct dynamical regimes: (I)(II), (III), and (IV),, showing distinct behaviors. We characterize these behaviors by analytically computing the position distribution and persistence exponents. The position distribution shows a crossover from a strongly non-diffusive and anisotropic behavior at short-times to a diffusive isotropic behavior via an intermediate regime (II) or (III). In regime (II), we show that, the position distribution along the direction orthogonal to the initial orientation is a function of the scaled variablewith a non-trivial scaling function,. Furthermore, by computing the exact first-passage time distribution, we show that a novel persistence exponentemerges due to the direction reversal in this regime.	
[2101.11328] Recursive Decoding of Reed-Muller Codes Starting With the Higher-Rate Constituent Code	Mikhail Kamenev	This paper has been presented in part at the 2021 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory[1].M. Kamenev was with the Moscow Research Center Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. Moscow Russia. Email:	mikhailkamenev92@gmail.com	Recursive list decoding of Reed-Muller (RM) codes, with moderate list size, is known to approach maximum-likelihood (ML) performance of short lengthRM codes. Recursive decoding employs the Plotkin construction to split the original code into two shorter RM codes with different rates. In contrast to the standard approach which decodes the lower-rate code first, the method in this paper decodes the higher-rate code first. This modification enables an efficient permutation-based decoding technique, with permutations being selected on the fly from the automorphism group of the code using soft information from a channel. Simulation results show that the error-rate performance of the proposed algorithms, enhanced by a permutation selection technique, is close to that of the automorphism-based recursive decoding algorithm with similar complexity for short RM codes, while our decoders perform better for longer RM codes. In particular, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithms achieve near-ML performance for short RM codes and for RM codes of lengthand orderwith reasonable complexity.

In order to rationalize their properties and predict the behaviour of microgel suspensions, it is necessary to develop a coarse-graining strategy that starts from the accurate modelling of single particles. Here, we provide a numerical advancement of a recently-introduced model for charged co-polymerized microgels by improving the treatment of ionic groups in the polymer network. We investigate the thermoresponsive properties of the particles, in particular their swelling behaviour and structure, finding that, when charged groups are considered to be hydrophilic at all temperatures, highly charged microgels do not achieve a fully collapsed state, in favorable comparison to experiments. In addition, we explicitly include the solvent in the description and put forward a mapping between the solvophobic potential in the absence of the solvent and the monomer-solvent interactions in its presence, which is found to work very accurately for any charge fraction of the microgel. Our work paves the way for comparing single-particle properties and swelling behaviour of ionic microgels to experiments and to tackle the study of these charged soft particles at a liquid-liquid interface.

RobertsDepartment of Engineering ScienceUniversity of OxfordOxford,		ball@robots.ox.ac.uk sjrob@robots.ox.ac.uk	Two popular approaches to model-free continuous control tasks are SAC and TD3. At first glance these approaches seem rather different; SAC aims to solve the entropy-augmented MDP by minimising the KL-divergence between a stochastic proposal policy and a hypotheical energy-basd soft Q-function policy, whereas TD3 is derived from DPG, which uses a deterministic policy to perform policy gradient ascent along the value function. In reality, both approaches are remarkably similar, and belong to a family of approaches we call ‘Off-Policy Continuous Generalized Policy Iteration’. This illuminates their similar performance in most continuous control benchmarks, and indeed when hyperparameters are matched, their performance can be statistically indistinguishable. To further remove any difference due to implementation, we provideOffCon(Off-PolicyContinuousControl:Consolidated), a code base featuring state-of-the-art versions of both algorithms.

Many studies attribute these difficulties to imprecise phonological encoding of words in the lexical memory. We test an alternative hypothesis: that some of these difficulties can arise from the non-native speakers' phonetic perception. We train a computational model of phonetic learning, which has no access to phonology, on either one or two languages. We first show that the model exhibits predictable behaviors on phone-level and word-level discrimination tasks. We then test the model on a spoken word processing task, showing that phonology may not be necessary to explain some of the word processing effects observed in non-native speakers. We run an additional analysis of the model's lexical representation space, showing that the two training languages are not fully separated in that space, similarly to the languages of a bilingual human speaker.

By ramping up the non-Hermitian coupling linearly in time through an exceptional point, defects are produced in much the same way as approaching a Hermitian critical point. A generalized Kibble–Zurek scaling accounted for the ensuing scaling of the defect density in terms of the speed of the drive and the corresponding critical exponents. Here we extend this setting by adding the recycling term and considering the full Lindbladian time evolution of the problem with quantum jumps. We find that by linearly ramping up the environmental coupling in time, and going beyond the steady-state solution of the Liouvillian, the defect density scales linearly with the speed of the drive for all cases. This scaling is unaffected by the presence of exceptional points of the Liouvillian, which can show up in the transient states. By using a variant of the adiabatic perturbation theory, the scaling of the defect density is determined exactly from a set ofalgebraicequations.Our study indicates the distinct sensitivity of the Lindbladian time evolution to exceptional points corresponding to steady states and transient states.	
[2101.11335] On the Interpretability of Deep Learning Based Models for Knowledge Tracing	Xinyi Ding,1Eric C. Larson2			Knowledge tracing allows Intelligent Tutoring Systems to infer which topics or skills a student has mastered, thus adjusting curriculum accordingly. Deep Learning based models like Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and Dynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN) have achieved significant improvements compared with models like Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Performance Factors Analysis (PFA). However, these deep learning based models are not as interpretable as other models because the decision-making process learned by deep neural networks is not wholly understood by the research community. In previous work, we critically examined the DKT model, visualizing and analyzing the behaviors of DKT in high dimensional space. In this work, we extend our original analyses with a much larger dataset and add discussions about the memory states of the DKVMN model. We discover that Deep Knowledge Tracing has some critical pitfalls: 1) instead of tracking each skill through time, DKT is more likely to learn an ‘ability’ model; 2) the recurrent nature of DKT reinforces irrelevant information that it uses during the tracking task; 3) an untrained recurrent network can achieve similar results to a trained DKT model, supporting a conclusion that recurrence relations are not properly learned and, instead, improvements are simply a benefit of projection into a high dimensional, sparse vector space. Based on these observations, we propose improvements and future directions for conducting knowledge tracing research using deep neural network models.

Two rigorous results of so-called effective mass theorems in solid state physics are obtained: a general abstract result (beyond the classical stationary ergodic setting), and one for quasi-perfect materials (i.e. the disorder in the non-crystalline matter is limited). The former relies on the double-scale limits and the wave function is spanned on the Bloch basis. Therefore, we have extended the Bloch Theory which was restrict until now to crystals (periodic setting). The second result relies on the Perturbation Theory and a special case of stochastic deformations, namely stochastic perturbation of the identity.	Key words and phrases.

Results in the literature suggest this point–like source is likely a massive progenitor of 60–80 M, depending on if the source is a binary, a single star, or a compact cluster. Using new photometric and spectral data collected for 200 days, including several nebular spectra, we generate a consistent model covering the photospheric and nebular phase using a Monte Carlo radiation transport code. Photospheric phase modelling finds an ejected mass 1.2–2.0 Mwith anoferg, with approximately 1 Mof material below 5000 km sfound from the nebular spectra. Both photospheric and nebular phase modelling suggests aNi mass of 0.08–0.1 M. Modelling the [Oi] emission feature in the nebular spectra suggests the innermost ejecta is asymmetric. The modelling results favour a low mass progenitor of to 16–20 Mwhich is in disagreement with the pre–supernova derived high mass progenitor. This contradiction is likely due to the pre–supernova source not representing the actual progenitor.	supernovae: general–radiative transfer–supernovae: individual: SN2017ein

There exists a significant gap between the architectures in search and evaluation. As a result, current methods suffer from an inconsistent, inefficient, and inflexible search process. In this paper, we introduce EnTranNAS that is composed ofEngine-cells andTransit-cells. The Engine-cell is differentiable for architecture search, while the Transit-cell only transits a sub-graph by architecture derivation. Consequently, the gap between the architectures in search and evaluation is significantly reduced. Our method also spares much memory and computation cost, which speeds up the search process. A feature sharing strategy is introduced for more balanced optimization and more efficient search. Furthermore, we develop an architecture derivation method to replace the traditional one that is based on a hand-crafted rule. Our method enables differentiable sparsification, and keeps the derived architecture equivalent to that of Engine-cell, which further improves the consistency between search and evaluation. Besides, it supports the search for topology where a node can be connected to prior nodes with any number of connections, so that the searched architectures could be more flexible. For experiments on CIFAR-10, our search on the standard space requires only 0.06 GPU-day. We further have an error rate of 2.22% with 0.07 GPU-day for the search on an extended space. We can also directly perform the search on ImageNet with topology learnable and achieve a top-1 error rate of 23.8% in 2.1 GPU-day.

Department of Electronic and Information EngineeringThe Hong Kong Polytechnic UniversityEmails:	qipeng.wang@connect.polyu.hk	This paper considers joint device activity detection and channel estimation in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where a large number of IoT devices exist but merely a random subset of them become active for short-packet transmission at each time slot. In particular, to improve the detection performance, we propose to leverage thetemporal correlationin user activity, i.e., a device active at the previous time slot is more likely to be still active at the current time slot. Despite the appealing temporal correlation feature, it is challenging to unveil the connection between the estimated activity pattern for the previous time slot (which may be imperfect) and the true activity pattern at the current time slot due to the unknown estimation error. In this paper, we manage to tackle this challenge under the framework of approximate message passing (AMP). Specifically, thanks to the state evolution, the correlation between the activity pattern estimated by AMP at the previous time slot and the real activity pattern at the previous and current time slot is quantified explicitly. Based on the well-defined temporal correlation, we further manage to embed this useful SI into the design of the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoisers and log-likelihood ratio (LLR) test based activity detectors under the AMP framework. Theoretical comparison between the SI-aided AMP algorithm and its counterpart without utilizing temporal correlation is provided. Moreover, numerical results are given which show the significant gain in activity detection accuracy brought by the SI-aided algorithm.

While living organisms often exploit phase separation to directly assemble structurally colored materials from macromolecules, synthetic structural colors are typically produced in a two-step process involving the sequential synthesis and assembly of building blocks. Phase separation is attractive for its simplicity, but applications are limited due to a lack of robust methods for its control. A central challenge is to arrest phase separation at the desired length scale. Here, we show that solid-state polymerization-induced phase separation can produce stable structures at optical length scales. In this process, a polymeric solid is swollen and softened with a second monomer. During its polymerization, the two polymers become immiscible and phase separate. As free monomer is depleted, the host matrix resolidifies and arrests coarsening. The resulting polymeric composites have a blue or white appearance. We compare these biomimetic nanostructures to those in structurally-colored feather barbs, and demonstrate the flexibility of this approach by producing structural color in filaments and large sheets.	phase-separation | polymerization | structural color | biophotonic | biomimetic
[2101.11346] New estimations of the added mass and damping of two cylinders vibrating in a viscous fluid, from theoretical and numerical approaches	Romain Lagrange Yann Fraigneau	Den-Service d’Etudes Mécaniques et Thermiques (SEMT) CEA Université Paris-Saclay F-91191 Gif-sur-Yvette 	romain.lagrange@cea.fr romain.g.lagrange@gmail.com	This paper deals with the small oscillations of two circular cylinders immersed in a viscous stagnant fluid. A new theoretical approach based on an Helmholtz expansion and a bipolar coordinate system is presented to estimate the fluid forces acting on the two bodies. We show that these forces are linear combinations of thecylinder accelerationsand velocities, through viscous fluid added coefficients.To assess the validity of this theory, we consider the case of two equal size cylinders, one of them being stationary while the other one is forced sinusoidally. The self-added mass and damping coefficients are shown to decrease with both the Stokes number and the separation distance. The cross-added mass and damping coefficients tend to increase with the Stokes number and the separation distance. Compared to the inviscid results, the effect of viscosity is to add a correction term which scales as. When the separation distance is sufficiently large, the two cylinders behave as if they were independent and the Stokes predictions for an isolated cylinder are recovered. Compared to previous works, the present theory offers a simple and flexible alternative for an easy determination of the fluid forces and related added coefficients. To our knowledge, this is also the first time that a numerical approach based on a penalization method is presented in the context of fluid-structure interactions for relatively small Stokes numbers, and successfully compared to theoretical predictions.

[2101.11347] Decision Machines: Interpreting Decision Tree as a Model Combination Method	Jinxiong		jinxiongzhang@qq.com	Based on decision trees, it is efficient to handle tabular data. Conventional decision tree growth methods often result in suboptimal trees because of their greedy nature. Their inherent structure limits the options of hardware to implement decision trees in parallel. Here is a compact representation of binary decision trees to overcome these deficiencies. We explicitly formulate the dependence of prediction on binary tests for binary decision trees and construct a function to guide the input sample from the root to the appropriate leaf node. And based on this formulation we introduce a new interpretation of binary decision trees. Then we approximate this formulation via continuous functions. Finally we interpret decision tree as a model combination method. And we propose the selection-prediction scheme to unify a few learning methods.

A variety of channel estimation methods have been proposed for such systems; however, none of the existing methods takes into account the effect of synchronization errors such as carrier frequency offset (CFO). In general, CFO can significantly degrade the channel estimation performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Motivated by this, we investigate the effect of CFO on channel estimation for RIS-aided OFDM systems. Furthermore, we propose a joint CFO and channel impulse response (CIR) estimation method for these systems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and also demonstrate that the use of time-domain rather than frequency-domain estimation in this context results in an improvement in the mean-squared error (MSE) performance of channel estimation as well as in a significantly lower overall computational complexity.

[2101.11349] Triangular Bidword Generation for Sponsored Search Auction	Zhenqiao Song, Jiaze Chen, Hao Zhou, Lei Li	ByteDance AI	lileilab@bytedance.com	Sponsored search auction is a crucial component of modern search engines. It requires a set of candidate bidwords that advertisers can place bids on. Existing methods generate bidwords from search queries or advertisement content. However, they suffer from the data noise in ¡query, bidword¿ and ¡advertisement, bidword¿ pairs. In this paper, we propose a triangular bidword generation model (TRIDENT), which takes the high-quality data of paired ¡query, advertisement¿ as a supervision signal to indirectly guide the bidword generation process. Our proposed model is simple yet effective: by using bidword as the bridge between search query and advertisement, the generation of search query, advertisement and bidword can be jointly learned in the triangular training framework. This alleviates the problem that the training data of bidword may be noisy. Experimental results, including automatic and human evaluations, show that our proposed TRIDENT can generate relevant and diverse bidwords for both search queries and advertisements. Our evaluation on online real data validates the effectiveness of the TRIDENT’s generated bidwords for product search.	sponsored search | advertising bidword generation | query expansion | triangle training

[2101.11351] Compositional Semantics for Probabilistic Programs with Exact Conditioning	Dario Stein Sam Staton	University of Oxford UK		We define a probabilistic programming language for Gaussian random variables with a first-class exact conditioning construct. We give operational, denotational and equational semantics for this language, establishing convenient properties like exchangeability of conditions. Conditioning on equality of continuous random variables is nontrivial, as the exact observation may have probability zero; this isBorel’s paradox. Using categorical formulations of conditional probability, we show that the good properties of our language are not particular to Gaussians, but can be derived from universal properties, thus generalizing to wider settings. We define the Cond construction, which internalizes conditioning as a morphism, providing general compositional semantics for probabilistic programming with exact conditioning.

These meta-learning approaches achieve the expected performance in the scenario where all samples are drawn from the same distributions (i.i.d. observations). However, in real-world applications, few-shot learning paradigm often suffers from data shift, i.e., samples in different tasks, even in the same task, could be drawn from various data distributions. Most existing few-shot learning approaches are not designed with the consideration of data shift, and thus show downgraded performance when data distribution shifts. However, it is non-trivial to address the data shift problem in few-shot learning, due to the limited number of labeled samples in each task. Targeting at addressing this problem, we propose a novel metric-based meta-learning framework to extract task-specific representations and task-shared representations with the help of knowledge graph. The data shift within/between tasks can thus be combated by the combination of task-shared and task-specific representations. The proposed model is evaluated on popular benchmarks and two constructed new challenging datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate its remarkable performance.

Gupta	The authors are with the Department of Electrical Engineering Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur Kanpur India 208016. Email:	grkabhi@iitk.ac.in	This work is focused on the system-level performance of a broadcast network. Since all transmitters in a broadcast network transmit the identical signal, received signals from multiple transmitters can be combined to improve system performance. We develop a stochastic geometry based analytical framework to derive the coverage of a typical receiver. We show that there may exist an optimal connectivity radius that maximizes the rate coverage. Our analysis includes the fact that users may have their individual content/advertisement preferences. We assume that there are multiple classes of users with each user class prefers a particular type of content/advertisements and the users will pay the network only when then can see content aligned with their interest. The operator may choose to transmit multiple contents simultaneously to cater more users’ interests to increase its revenue. We present revenue models to study the impact of the number of contents on the operator revenue. We consider two scenarios for users’ distribution- one where users’ interest depends on their geographical location and the one where it doesn’t. With the help of numerical results and analysis, we show the impact of various parameters including content granularity, connectivity radius, and rate threshold and present important design insights.

Mizerski\aff2 Mouloud Kessar\aff3		cajones@maths.leeds.ac.uk	Anelastic convection at high Rayleigh number in a plane parallel layer with no slip boundaries is considered. Energy and entropy balance equations are derived, and they are used to develop scaling laws for the heat transport and the Reynolds number. The appearance of an entropy structure consisting of a well-mixed uniform interior, bounded by thin layers with entropy jumps across them, makes it possible to derive explicit forms for these scaling laws. These are given in terms of the Rayleigh number, the Prandtl number, and the bottom to top temperature ratio, which measures how stratified the layer is. The top and bottom boundary layers are examined and they are found to be very different, unlike in the Boussinesq case. Elucidating the structure of these boundary layers plays a crucial part in determining the scaling laws. Physical arguments governing these boundary layers are presented, concentrating on the case in which the boundary layers are thin even when the stratification is large, the incompressible boundary layer case. Different scaling laws are found, depending on whether the viscous dissipation is primarily in the boundary layers or in the bulk. The cases of both high and low Prandtl number are considered. Numerical simulations of no-slip anelastic convection up to a Rayleigh number ofhave been performed and our theoretical predictions are compared with the numerical results.

Nowadays, the majority of automatic decision making systems are based on data. However, it is well known that machine learning systems can present problematic results if they are built on partial or incomplete data. In fact, in recent years several studies have found a convergence of issues related to the ethics and transparency of these systems in the process of data collection and how they are recorded. Although the process of rigorous data collection and analysis is fundamental in the model design, this step is still largely overlooked by the machine learning community. For this reason, we propose a method of data annotation based on Bayesian statistical inference that aims to warn about the risk of discriminatory results of a given data set. In particular, our method aims to deepen knowledge and promote awareness about the sampling practices employed to create the training set, highlighting that the probability of success or failure conditioned to a minority membership is given by the structure of the data available. We empirically test our system on three datasets commonly accessed by the machine learning community and we investigate the risk of racial discrimination.	human annotation | data ethics | race discrimination | sampling bias | data labeling | machine learning

M. Burgers Centre for Fluid Dynamics University of Twente P.O. Box 217 7500 AE Enschede The Netherlands	yanshen.li@utwente.nl d.lohse@utwente.nl	Marangoni instabilities can emerge when a liquid interface is subjected to a concentration or temperature gradient. It is generally believed that for these instabilities bulk effects like buoyancy are negligible as compared to interfacial forces, especially on small scales. Consequently, the effect of a stable stratification on the Marangoni instability has hitherto been ignored. Here we report, for an immiscible drop immersed in a stably stratified ethanol-water mixture, a new type of oscillatory solutal Marangoni instability which is triggered once the stratification has reached a critical value. We experimentally explore the parameter space spanned by the stratification strength and the drop size and theoretically explain the observed crossover from levitating to bouncing by balancing the advection and diffusion around the drop. Finally, the effect of the stable stratification on the Marangoni instability is surprisingly amplified in confined geometries, leading to an earlier onset.	
[2101.11363] KoreALBERT: Pretraining a Lite BERT Model for Korean Language Understanding	Hyunjae Lee, Jaewoong Yoon, Bonggyu Hwang, Seongho Joe, Seungjai Min, Youngjune Gwon	Samsung SDS		A Lite BERT (ALBERT) has been introduced to scale up deep bidirectional representation learning for natural languages. Due to the lack of pretrained ALBERT models for Korean language, the best available practice is the multilingual model or resorting back to the any other BERT-based model. In this paper, we develop and pretrain KoreALBERT, a monolingual ALBERT model specifically for Korean language understanding. We introduce a new training objective, namely Word Order Prediction (WOP), and use alongside the existing MLM and SOP criteria to the same architecture and model parameters. Despite having significantly fewer model parameters (thus, quicker to train), our pretrained KoreALBERT outperforms its BERT counterpart on 6 different NLU tasks. Consistent with the empirical results in English by Lan et al., KoreALBERT seems to improve downstream task performance involving multi-sentence encoding for Korean language. The pretrained KoreALBERT is publicly available to encourage research and application development for Korean NLP.	
[2101.11364] Overcoming finite-size effects in electronic structure simulations at extreme conditions	Tobias Dornheim Jan Vorberger	for Advanced Systems Understanding (CASUS) D-02826 Görlitz Germany	t.dornheim@hzdr.de	Ab initioquantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods in principle allow for the calculation of exact properties of correlated many-electron systems, but are in general limited to the simulation of a finite number of electronsin periodic boundary conditions. Therefore, an accurate theory of finite-size effects is indispensable to bridge the gap to realistic applications in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we revisit the uniform electron gas (UEG) at finite temperature as it is relevant to contemporary research e.g. in the field of warm dense matter. In particular, we present a new scheme to eliminate finite-size effects both in the static structure factorand in the interaction energy, which is based on the density response formalism. We demonstrate that this method often allows to obtainin the TDL within a relative accuracy offrom as few aselectrons without any empirical choices or knowledge of results for other values of. Finally, we evaluate the applicability of our method upon increasing the density parameterand decreasing the temperature.

Specifically, we extend MLIR with a new quantum dialect that enables the expression and compilation of common quantum assembly languages. The true utility of this dialect is in its ability to be lowered to the LLVM intermediate representation (IR) in a manner that is adherent to the quantum intermediate representation (QIR) specification recently proposed by Microsoft. We leverage aqcor-enabled implementation of the QIR quantum runtime API to enable a retargetable (quantum hardware agnostic) compiler workflow mapping quantum languages to hybrid quantum-classical binary executables and object code. We evaluate and demonstrate this novel compiler workflow with quantum programs written in OpenQASM 2.0. We provide concrete examples detailing the generation of MLIR from OpenQASM source files, the lowering process from MLIR to LLVM IR, and ultimately the generation of executable binaries targeting available quantum processors.	quantum computing | quantum programming | quantum simulation | programming languages

Charles Street, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA	E-mail:	csogeza@mpa-garching.mpg.de	We investigate the effect of strong emission line galaxies on the performance of empirical photometric redshift estimation methods. In order to artificially control the contribution of photometric error and emission lines to total flux, we develop a PCA-based stochastic mock catalogue generation technique that allows for generating infinite signal-to-noise ratio model spectra with realistic emission lines on top of theoretical stellar continua. Instead of running the computationally expensive stellar population synthesis and nebular emission codes, our algorithm generates realistic spectra with a statistical approach, and – as an alternative to attempting to constrain the priors on input model parameters – works by matching output observational parameters. Hence, it can be used to match the luminosity, colour, emission line and photometric error distribution of any photometric sample with sufficient flux-calibrated spectroscopic follow-up. We test three simple empirical photometric estimation methods and compare the results with and without photometric noise and strong emission lines. While photometric noise clearly dominates the uncertainty of photometric redshift estimates, the key findings are that emission lines play a significant role in resolving colour space degeneracies and good spectroscopic coverage of the entire colour space is necessary to achieve good results with empirical photo-z methods. Template fitting methods, on the other hand, must use a template set with sufficient variation in emission line strengths and ratios, or even better, first estimate the redshift empirically and fit the colours with templates at the best-fit redshift to calculate the K-correction and various physical parameters.	methods: data analysis – galaxies: active – galaxies: starburst

Fessler is with the Department of EECS University of Michigan Ann Arbor MI 48109 USA	fessler@umich.edu	Optimizing k-space sampling trajectories is a promising yet challenging topic for fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This work proposes to optimize a reconstruction method and sampling trajectories jointly concerning image reconstruction quality in a supervised learning manner. We parameterize trajectories with quadratic B-spline kernels to reduce the number of parameters and apply multi-scale optimization, which may help to avoid sub-optimal local minima. The algorithm includes an efficient non-Cartesian unrolled neural network-based reconstruction and an accurate approximation for backpropagation through the non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) operator to accurately reconstruct and back-propagate multi-coil non-Cartesian data. Penalties on slew rate and gradient amplitude enforce hardware constraints. Sampling and reconstruction are trained jointly using large public datasets. To correct for possible eddy-current effects introduced by the curved trajectory, we use a pencil-beam trajectory mapping technique. In both simulations and in-vivo experiments, the learned trajectory demonstrates significantly improved image quality compared to previous model-based and learning-based trajectory optimization methods for 10acceleration factors. Though trained with neural network-based reconstruction, the proposed trajectory also leads to improved image quality with compressed sensing-based reconstruction.	{IEEEkeywords}

Seymour	institutetext:	lighina@uninsubria.it	We report the 888 MHz radio detection in the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) of VIK J23183113, a=6.44 quasar. Its radio luminosity (1.2W Hzat 5 GHz) compared to the optical luminosity (1.8W Hzat 4400 Å) makes it the most distant radio-loud quasar observed so far, with a radio loudness R70 (R). Moreover, the high bolometric luminosity of the source (L=7.4erg s) suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole with a high mass (610M) at a time when the Universe was younger than a billion years. Combining the new radio data from RACS with previous ASKAP observations at the same frequency, we found that the flux density of the source may have varied by a factor of2, which could suggest the presence of a relativistic jet oriented towards the line of sight, that is, a blazar nature. However, currently available radio data do not allow us to firmly characterise the orientation of the source. Further radio and X-ray observations are needed.

We extend previous work by calculating the lensing contribution to the full-sky 21cm bispectrum in redshift space. The lensing contribution tends to peak when equal-redshift fluctuations are lensed by a lower redshift fluctuation. At high redshift, lensing effects can become comparable to the contributions from density and redshift-space distortions.

Considering that manual diagnosis could be error-prone and time-consuming, many intelligent approaches based on clinical text mining have been proposed to perform automatic diagnosis. However, these methods may not achieve satisfactory results due to the following challenges. First, most of the diagnosis codes are rare, and the distribution is extremely unbalanced. Second, existing methods are challenging to capture the correlation between diagnosis codes. Third, the lengthy clinical note leads to the excessive dispersion of key information related to codes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework to combine the inheritance-guided hierarchical assignment and co-occurrence graph propagation for clinical automatic diagnosis. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical joint prediction strategy to address the challenge of unbalanced codes distribution. Then, we utilize graph convolutional neural networks to obtain the correlation and semantic representations of medical ontology. Furthermore, we introduce multi attention mechanisms to extract crucial information. Finally, extensive experiments on MIMIC-III dataset clearly validate the effectiveness of our method.	clinical automatic diagnosis hierarchical assignment co-occurrence graph graph convolutional network.

This system features different interactions that act on disparate length scales, from zero-range defect scattering of atomic excitations and finite-range dipolar exchange processes to long-range Rydberg-state interactions, which span the entire array and can block multiple Rydberg excitations. Analyzing their interplay, we identify conditions that yield a nonlinear quantum mirror which coherently splits incident fields into correlated photon-pairs in a single transverse mode, while transmitting single photons unaffected. In particular, we find strong anti-bunching of the transmitted light with equal-time pair correlations that decrease exponentially with an increasing range of the Rydberg blockade. Such strong photon-photon interactions in the absence of photon losses open up promising avenues for the generation and manipulation of quantum light, and the exploration of many-body phenomena with interacting photons.

Abstract representations ignore specific details and facilitate generalization. Here we consider the learning of abstract representations in a multi-modal setting with two or more input modalities. We treat the problem as a lossy compression problem and show that generic lossy compression of multimodal sensory input naturally extracts abstract representations that tend to strip away modalitiy specific details and preferentially retain information that is shared across the different modalities. Specifically, we propose an architecture that is able to extract information common to different modalities based on the compression abilities of generic autoencoder neural networks. We test the architecture with two tasks that allow 1) the precise manipulation of the amount of information contained in and shared across different modalities and 2) testing the method on a simulated robot with visual and proprioceptive inputs. Our results show the validity of the proposed approach and demonstrate the applicability to embodied agents.	open-ended learning | abstraction | multimodality | lossy compression | autoencoder | intrinsic motivation.

[2101.11378] Finite difference method for inhomogeneous fractional Dirichlet problem	Jing Sun Weihua Deng Daxin Nie		dengwh@lzu.edu.cn ndx1993@163.com sunj18@lzu.edu.cn	We make the split of the integral fractional Laplacian as, where. Based on this splitting, we respectively discretize the one- and two-dimensional integral fractional Laplacian with the inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and give the corresponding truncation errors with the help of the interpolation estimate. Moreover, the suitable corrections are proposed to guarantee the convergence in solving the inhomogeneous fractional Dirichlet problem and anconvergence rate is obtained when the solution, whereis the dimension of the space,,is a fixed positive constant, anddenotes mesh size. Finally, the performed numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.	one- and two-dimensional integral fractional Laplacian | Lagrange interpolation | operator splitting | finite difference | the inhomogeneous fractional Dirichlet problem | error estimates

[2101.11380] Countering a fundamental law of attraction with quantum wavepacket engineering	G. Amit Y. Japha T. Shushi R. Folman E. Cohen	Faculty of Engineering and the Institute of Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials Bar Ilan University Ramat Gan 5290002 IsraelSoreq Nuclear Research Center Yavne Israel		Bohmian mechanics was designed to give rise to predictions identical to those derived by standard quantum mechanics, while invoking a specific interpretation of it – one which allows the classical notion of a particle to be maintained alongside a guiding wave. For this, the Bohmian model makes use of a uniquequantum potentialwhich governs the trajectory of the particle. In this work we show that this interpretation of quantum theory naturally leads to the derivation of interesting new phenomena. Specifically, we demonstrate how the fundamental Casimir-Polder force, by which atoms are attracted to a surface, may be temporarily suppressed by utilizing a specially designed quantum potential. We show that when harnessing the quantum potential via a suitable atomic wavepacket engineering, the absorption by the surface can be dramatically reduced. This is proven both analytically and numerically. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed for achieving the required shape for the atomic wavepacket. All these may enable new insights into Bohmian mechanics as well as new applications to metrology and sensing.	pacs:34.50.Dy | 03.75.Kk

[2101.11383] One-dimensional colloidal model with dielectric inhomogeneity	Lucas Varela Gabriel Téllez Emmanuel Trizac	Université Paris-Saclay CNRS LPTMS 91405 Orsay France.Universidad de los Andes Bogotá Colombia		We consider a one-dimensional model allowing analytical derivation of the effective interactions between two charged colloids. We evaluate exactly the partition function for an electroneutral salt-free suspension with dielectric jumps at the colloids’ position. We derive a contact relation with the pressure that shows there is like-charge attraction, whether or not the counterions are confined between the colloids. In contrast to the homogeneous dielectric case, there is the possibility for the colloids to attract despite the number of counter-ions () being even. The results are shown to recover the mean-field prediction in the limit.

[2101.11385] Extensions of the AZ-algorithm and the Package MultiIntegrate	Jakob Ablinger	institutetext:	Jakob.Ablinger@risc.jku.at	We extend the (continuous) multivariate Almkvist-Zeilberger algorithm in order to apply it for instance to special Feynman integrals emerging in renormalizable Quantum field Theories. We will consider multidimensional integrals over hyperexponential integrals and try to find closed form representations in terms of nested sums and products or iterated integrals. In addition, if we fail to compute a closed form solution in full generality, we may succeed in computing the first coefficients of the Laurent series expansions of such integrals in terms of indefinite nested sums and products or iterated integrals. In this article we present the corresponding methods and algorithms. Our Mathematica packageMultiIntegrate, can be considered as an enhanced implementation of the (continuous) multivariate Almkvist Zeilberger algorithm to compute recurrences or differential equations for hyperexponential integrands and integrals. Together with the summation packageSigmaand the packageHarmonicSumsour package provides methods to compute closed form representations (or coefficients of the Laurent series expansions) of multidimensional integrals over hyperexponential integrands in terms of nested sums or iterated integrals.	
[2101.11386] Locally Eventually Positive Operator Semigroups	Sahiba Arora	Sahiba Arora Technische Universität Dresden Institut für Analysis Fakultät für Mathematik 01062 Dresden 	sahiba.arora@mailbox.tu-dresden.de	We initiate a theory of locally eventually positive operator semigroups on Banach lattices. Intuitively this means: given a positive initial datum, the solution of the corresponding Cauchy problem becomes (and stays) positive in a part of the domain, after a sufficiently large time. A drawback of the present theory of eventually positive-semigroups is that it is applicable only when the leading eigenvalue of the semigroup generator has a strongly positive eigenvector. We weaken this requirement and give sufficient criteria for individual and uniform local eventual positivity of the semigroup. This allows us to treat a larger class of examples by giving us more freedom on the domain when dealing with function spaces – for instance, the square of the Laplace operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions onand the Dirichlet bi-Laplacian on-spaces. Besides, we establish various spectral and convergence properties of locally eventually positive semigroups.

[2101.11387] Quantum tomography with random diagonal unitary maps and statistical bounds on information generation using random matrix theory	Sreeram PG Vaibhav Madhok	Department of Physics Indian Institute of Technology Madras Chennai India 600036		We study quantum tomography from a continuous measurement record obtained by measuring expectation values of a set of Hermitian operators obtained from unitary evolution of an initial observable. For this purpose, we consider the application of a random unitary, diagonal in a fixed basis at each time step and quantify the information gain in tomography using Fisher information of the measurement record and the Shannon entropy associated with the eigenvalues of covariance matrix of the estimation. Surprisingly, very high fidelity of reconstruction is obtained using random unitaries diagonal in a fixed basis even though the measurement record is not informationally complete. We then compare this with the information generated and fidelities obtained by application of a different Haar random unitary at each time step. We give an upper bound on the maximal information that can be obtained in tomography and show that a covariance matrix taken from the Wishart-Laguerre ensemble of random matrices and the associated Marchenko-Pastur distribution saturates this bound. We find that physically, this corresponds to an application of a different Haar random unitary at each time step. We show that repeated application of random diagonal unitaries gives a covariance matrix in tomographic estimation that corresponds to a new ensemble of random matrices. We analytically and numerically estimate eigenvalues of this ensemble and show the information gain to be bounded from below by the Porter-Thomas distribution.

[2101.11389] Why polls fail to predict elections	Zhenkun Zhou Matteo Serafino Luciano Cohan Guido Caldarelli Hernán A. Makse	College of Statistics Capital University ofEconomics and Business Beijing 100070 China	hmakse@ccny.cuny.edu	In the past decade we have witnessed the failure of traditional polls in predicting presidential election outcomes across the world. To understand the reasons behind these failures we analyze the raw data of a trusted pollster which failed to predict, along with the rest of the pollsters, the surprising 2019 presidential election in Argentina which has led to a major market collapse in that country. Analysis of the raw and re-weighted data from longitudinal surveys performed before and after the elections reveals clear biases (beyond well-known low-response rates) related to mis-representation of the population and, most importantly, to social-desirability biases, i.e., the tendency of respondents to hide their intention to vote for controversial candidates. We then propose a longitudinal opinion tracking method based on big-data analytics from social media, machine learning, and network theory that overcomes the limits of traditional polls. The model achieves accurate results in the 2019 Argentina elections predicting the overwhelming victory of the candidate Alberto Fernández over the president Mauricio Macri; a result that none of the traditional pollsters in the country was able to predict. Beyond predicting political elections, the framework we propose is more general and can be used to discover trends in society; for instance, what people think about economics, education or climate change.

Transitioning from lab-based, proof-of-concept experiments to robust, integrated realizations of quantum information processing hardware is an important step in this process. However, the nature of traditional laboratory setups does not offer itself readily to scaling up system sizes or allow for applications outside of laboratory-grade environments. This transition requires overcoming challenges in engineering and integration without sacrificing the state-of-the-art performance of laboratory implementations. Here, we present a 19-inch rack quantum computing demonstrator based onCaoptical qubits in a linear Paul trap to address many of these challenges. We outline the mechanical, optical, and electrical subsystems. Further, we describe the automation and remote access components of the quantum computing stack. We conclude by describing characterization measurements relevant to quantum computing including site-resolved single-qubit interactions, and entangling operations mediated by theMølmer-Sørenseninteraction delivered via two distinct addressing approaches. Using this setup we produce maximally-entangled Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger states with up to 24 ions without the use of post-selection or error mitigation techniques; on par with well-established conventional laboratory setups.

Shi Jochen Triesch	Frankfurt Institute for Advanced StudiesFrankfurt Germany Email:	triesch@fias.uni-frankfurt.de eebert@ust.hk wilmot@fias.uni-frankfurt.de	We present a model of the self-calibration of active binocular vision comprising the simultaneous learning of visual representations, vergence, and pursuit eye movements. The model follows the principle of Active Efficient Coding (AEC), a recent extension of the classic Efficient Coding Hypothesis to active perception. In contrast to previous AEC models, the present model uses deep autoencoders to learn sensory representations. We also propose a new formulation of the intrinsic motivation signal that guides the learning of behavior. We demonstrate the performance of the model in simulations.	active efficient coding | intrinsic motivation | binocular vision | vergence | pursuit | self-calibration | autonomous learning

The pressure anisotropy along the spatial directions are derived and its stability in each direction has been examined. The four models presented here, show its stability on certain spatial direction. The role of matter field on the stability analysis has been obtained. The positive and negative value of cosmic string completely changed the stability behaviour of the model. The presence of a magnetic field disturbs the stability aspects of the models at least in an early epoch.	Keywords

Our approach is based on the asymptotic theory of-semigroups and recent results developed for coupled control systems. As our main results, we represent the system as a feedback interconnection between the wave part and the Coleman–Gurtin part and we show that the associated semigroup in the history framework of Dafermos is polynomially stable with optimal decay rateas. In particular, we obtain a sharp estimate for the rate of energy decay of classical solutions to the problem.

Here, we describe an experiment for the production and investigation of ultracold quantum gases capable of asynchronous remote control by multiple remote users. This is enabled by a queuing system coupled to an interface that can be modified to suit the user, e.g. a gamified interface for use by the general public or a scripted interface for an expert. To demonstrate this, the laboratory was opened to remote experts and the general public. During the available time, remote users were given the task of optimising the production of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). This work thus provides a stepping stone towards the exploration and realisation of more advanced physical models by remote experts, students and citizen scientists alike.	Keywords

They are events that recur with a frequency that is growing with the exponential increase in the world population and growth of the human ecological footprint. The latter causes a frequent spillover of transmissible diseases from wildlife to humans. The recent COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, is the latest example of a highly infectious disease that, since late 2019, is ravaging the globe with a huge toll in terms of human lives and socio-economic impact. It is therefore imperative to develop efficient mathematical models, able to substantially curb the damages of a pandemic by unveiling disease spreading dynamics and symmetries. This will help inform (non)-pharmaceutical prevention strategies. It is for the reasons above that we decided to write this report. It goes at the heart of mathematical modelling of infectious disease diffusion by simultaneously investigating the underlying microscopic dynamics in terms of percolation models, effective description via compartmental models and the employment of temporal symmetries naturally encoded in the mathematical language of critical phenomena. Our report reviews these approaches and determines their common denominators, relevant for theoretical epidemiology and its link to important concepts in theoretical physics. We show that the different frameworks exhibit common features such as criticality and self-similarity under time rescaling. These features are naturally encoded within the unifying field theoretical approach. The latter leads to an efficient description of the time evolution of the disease via a framework in which (near) time-dilation invariance is explicitly realised. As important test of the relevance of symmetries we show how to mathematically account for observed phenomena such as multi-wave dynamics. Although we consider the COVID-19 pandemic as an explicit phenomenological application, the models presented here are of immediate relevance for different realms of scientific enquiry from medical applications to the understanding of human behaviour. Our review offers novel perspectives on how to model, capture, organise and understand epidemiological data and disease dynamics for modelling real-world phenomena, and helps devising public health and socio-economics strategies.	epidemiology | field theory

We show that the gravitational field of our Galaxy and other nearby cosmic objects changes this composition near the Solar System, enriching it with the heaviest neutrino. This mass state is almost free of the electron component (onlyof) and contains more muon component than the tau one. As a result, the relic background becomes enriched with taon and particularly muon neutrinos.

Upton Adam Pound	School of Mathematical Sciences and STAG Research Centre University of Southampton Southampton United Kingdom SO17 1BJ		Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) will be key sources for LISA. However, accurately extracting system parameters from a detected EMRI waveform will require self-force calculations at second order in perturbation theory, which are still in a nascent stage. One major obstacle in these calculations is the strong divergences that are encountered on the worldline of the small object. Previously, it was shown by one of us [Phys. Rev. D 95, 104056 (2017)] that a class of “highly regular” gauges exist in which the singularities have a qualitatively milder form, promising to enable more efficient numerical calculations. Here we derive expressions for the metric perturbation in this class of gauges, in a local expansion in powers of distancefrom the worldline, to sufficient order infor numerical implementation in a puncture scheme. Additionally, we use the highly regular class to rigorously derive a distributional source for the second-order field and a pointlike second-order stress-energy tensor (theDetweiler stress-energy) for the small object. This makes it possible to calculate the second-order self-force using mode-sum regularisation rather than the more cumbersome puncture schemes that have been necessary previously. Although motivated by EMRIs, our calculations are valid in an arbitrary vacuum background, and they may help clarify the interpretation of point masses and skeleton sources in general relativity more broadly.

In this paper, we propose a novel data analysis framework with reproducing kernel Hilbert-module (RKHM) and kernel mean embedding (KME) in RKHM. Since RKHM contains richer information than RKHS or vector-valued RKHS (vvRKHS), analysis with RKHM enables us to capture and extract structural properties in such as functional data. We show a branch of theories for RKHM to apply to data analysis, including the representer theorem, and the injectivity and universality of the proposed KME. We also show RKHM generalizes RKHS and vvRKHS. Then, we provide concrete procedures for employing RKHM and the proposed KME to data analysis.

Using distance-selective exchange-interaction between Rydberg excited atoms in an atomic-array with dual lattice-constants, the new setup operates both coined and coin-less models of discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). Here, complicated coupling tessellations are performed by global laser that exclusively excite the site at the anti-blockade region. The long-range interaction provides a new feature of designing different topologically ordered periodic boundary conditions. Limiting the Rydberg population to two excitations, coherent QW over hundreds of lattice sites and steps are achievable with the current technology. These features would improve the performance of this quantum machine in running the quantum search algorithm over topologically ordered databases as well as diversifying the range of topological insulators that could be simulated.

Rev. D 100, no.10, 104022 (2019)]. This assumption considers that the energy of the particle changes the enthalpy of the black hole after throwing the particle into the black hole. Using the energy-momentum relation, the results show that the second law of thermodynamics of the black hole is valid in extended phase space. In this paper, we discuss the validity of the laws of thermodynamics and the stability of the horizon of the charged AdS black hole by scalar field scattering under two assumptions, i.e., the energy flux of the scalar fieldchanges the internal energy of the black holeand the energy flux of the scalar fieldchanges the enthalpy of the black hole.

R. China. (e-mail: {wtzhangee zqzuo 		A common trait involving the opinion dynamics in social networks is an anchor on interacting network to characterize the opinion formation process among participating social actors, such as information flow, cooperative and antagonistic influence, etc. Nevertheless, interacting networks are generally public for social groups, as well as other individuals who may be interested in. This blocks a more precise interpretation of the opinion formation process since social actors always have complex feeling, motivation and behavior, even beliefs that are personally private. In this paper, we formulate a general configuration on describing how individual’s opinion evolves in a distinct fashion. It consists of two functional networks: interacting network and appraisal network. Interacting network inherits the operational properties as DeGroot iterative opinion pooling scheme while appraisal network, forming a belief system, quantifies certain cognitive orientation to interested individuals’ beliefs, over which the adhered attitudes may have the potential to be antagonistic. We explicitly show that cooperative appraisal network always leads to consensus in opinions. Antagonistic appraisal network, however, causes opinion cluster. It is verified that antagonistic appraisal network affords to guarantee consensus by imposing some extra restrictions. They hence bridge a gap between the consensus and the clusters in opinion dynamics. We further attain a gauge on the appraisal network by means of the random convex optimization approach. Moreover, we extend our results to the case of mutually interdependent issues.	Social networks | appraisal network | cooperative/antagonistic interaction | random convex optimization.

[2101.11417] Importance of electronic correlations for the magnetic properties of the two-dimensional ferromagnet CoBr₂	Hrishit Banerjee Markus Aichhorn		h.banerjee10@gmail.com	We investigate the emergence of ferromagnetism in the two-dimensional metal-halide CoBr, with a special focus on the role of electronic correlations. The calculated phonon spectrum shows that the system is thermodynamically stable unlike other Co halides. We apply two well-known methods for the estimation of the Curie temperature. First, we do DFT+U calculations to calculate exchange couplings, which are subsequently used in a classical Monte Carlo simulation of the resulting Ising spin model. The transition temperature calculated in this way is in the order of 100 K, but shows a strong dependence on the choice of interaction parameters. Second, we apply dynamical mean-field theory to calculate the correlated electronic structure and estimate the transition temperature. This results in a similar estimate for a noticeable transition temperature of approximatelyK, however, without the strong dependence on the interaction parameters.The effect of electron-electron interactions are strongly orbital selective, with only moderate correlations in the three low-lying orbitals (one doublet plus one singlet), and strong correlations in the doublet at higher energy. This can be traced back to the electronic occupation in DMFT, with five electrons in the three low-lying orbitals and two electrons in the high-energy doublet, making the latter one half-filled. Nevertheless, the overall spectral gap is governed by the small gap originating from the low-lying doublet+singlet orbitals, which changes very weakly with interaction. In that sense, the system is close to a Mott metal-to-insulator transition, which has been shown previously to be a hot-spot for strong magnetism.

For example, 6G networks are capable of providing high-speed network access by exploiting higher frequency spectrum; high-throughout satellite communication services are also adopted to achieve pervasive coverage in remote and isolated areas. In order to enable seamless access, Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Communication Networks (ISTCN) has emerged as an important research area. ISTCN aims to provide high speed and pervasive network services by integrating broadband terrestrial mobile networks with satellite communication networks. As terrestrial mobile networks began to use higher frequency spectrum (between 3GHz to 40GHz) which overlaps with that of satellite communication (4GHz to 8GHz for C band and 26GHz to 40GHz for Ka band), there are opportunities and challenges. On one hand, satellite terminals can potentially access terrestrial networks in an integrated manner; on the other hand, there will be more congestion and interference in this spectrum, hence more efficient spectrum management techniques are required. In this paper, we propose a new technique to improve spectrum sharing performance by introducing Non-orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (NOMA) and Cognitive Radio (CR) in the spectrum sharing of ISTCN. In essence, NOMA technology improves spectrum efficiency by allowing different users to transmit on the same carrier and distinguishing users by user power levels while CR technology improves spectrum efficiency through dynamic spectrum sharing. Furthermore, some open researches and challenges in ISTCN will be discussed.

Natural Language Processing, particularly the task of Named Entity Recognition is no exception. The bulk of the learning methods that have produced state-of-the-art results have changed the deep learning model, the training method used, the training data itself or the encoding of the output of the NER system. In this paper, we review significant learning methods that have been employed for NER in the recent past and how they came about from the linear learning methods of the past. We also cover the progress of related tasks that are upstream or downstream to NER eg. sequence tagging, entity linking etc. wherever the processes in question have also improved NER results.

There are few researches on geographic text classification. However, the application of this task in Chinese is relatively rare. In our work, we intend to implement a method to extract text containing geographical entities from a large number of network text. The geographic information in these texts is of great practical significance to transportation, urban and rural planning, disaster relief and other fields. We use the method of graph convolutional neural network with attention mechanism to achieve this function. Graph attention networks is an improvement of graph convolutional neural networks. Compared with GCN, the advantage of GAT is that the attention mechanism is proposed to weight the sum of the characteristics of adjacent nodes. In addition, We construct a Chinese dataset containing geographical classification from multiple datasets of Chinese text classification. The Macro-F Score of the geoGAT we used reached 95% on the new Chinese dataset.	graph neural networks | attention mechanism | toponym recognition | text classification

The research community is now faced with the task of automatic detection of fake news, which carries real-world socio-political impact. One such research contribution came in the form of the Constraint@AAA12021 Shared Task on COVID19 Fake News Detection in English. In this paper, we shed light on a novel method we proposed as a part of this shared task. Our team introduced an approach to combine topical distributions from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with contextualized representations from XLNet. We also compared our method with existing baselines to show that XLNetTopic Distributions outperforms other approaches by attaining an F1-score of.

[2101.11426] Where have all the solar-like stars gone? Rotation period detectability at various inclinations and metallicities	Timo Reinhold Alexander I. Shapiro Veronika Witzke Nina-E. Nèmec Emre Işık Sami K. Solanki	Max-Planck-Institut für SonnensystemforschungJustus-von-Liebig-Weg 3 37077 Göttingen Germany		The plethora of photometric data collected by theKeplerspace telescope has promoted the detection of tens of thousands of stellar rotation periods. However, these periods are not found to an equal extent among different spectral types. Interestingly, early G-type stars with near-solar rotation periods are strongly underrepresented among those stars with known rotation periods. In this study we investigate whether the small number of such stars can be explained by difficulties in the period determination from photometric time series. For that purpose, we generate model light curves of early G-type stars with solar rotation periods for different inclination angles, metallicities and (magnitude-dependent) noise levels. We find that the detectability is determined by the predominant type of activity (i.e. spot or faculae domination) on the surface, which defines the degree of irregularity of the light curve, and further depends on the level of photometric noise. These two effects significantly complicate the period detection and explain the lack of solar-like stars with known near-solar rotation periods. We conclude that the rotation periods of the majority of solar-like stars with near-solar rotation periods remain undetected to date. Finally, we promote the use of new techniques to recover more periods of near-solar rotators.	
[2101.11427] One Model to Serve All: Star Topology Adaptive Recommender for Multi-Domain CTR Prediction	Xiang-Rong Sheng, Liqin Zhao Guorui Zhou, Xinyao Ding, Binding Dai, Qiang LuoSiran Yang, Jingshan Lv, Chi Zhang, Hongbo Deng, Xiaoqiang Zhu	Alibaba GroupBeijing China		Traditional industry recommendation systems usually use data in a single domain to train models and then serve the domain. However, a large-scale commercial platform often contains multiple domains, and its recommendation system often needs to make click-through rate (CTR) predictions for multiple domains. Generally, different domains may share some common user groups and items, and each domain may have its own unique user groups and items. Moreover, even the same user may have different behaviors in different domains. In order to leverage all the data from different domains, a single model can be trained to serve all domains. However, it is difficult for a single model to capture the characteristics of various domains and serve all domains well. On the other hand, training an individual model for each domain separately does not fully use the data from all domains. In this paper, we propose the Star Topology Adaptive Recommender (STAR) model to train a single model to serve all domains by leveraging data from all domains simultaneously, capturing the characteristics of each domain, and modeling the commonalities between different domains. Essentially, the network of each domain consists of two factorized networks: one centered network shared by all domains and the domain-specific network tailored for each domain. For each domain, we combine these two factorized networks and generate a unified network by element-wise multiplying the weights of the shared network and those of the domain-specific network, although these two factorized networks can be combined using other functions, which is open for further research. Most importantly, STAR can learn the shared network from all the data and adapt domain-specific parameters according to the characteristics of each domain. The experimental results from production data validate the superiority of the proposed STAR model. Since late 2020, STAR has been deployed in the display advertising system of Alibaba, obtaining 8.0% improvement on CTR and 6.0% increase on RPM (Revenue Per Mille).

[2101.11429] TSQA: Tabular Scenario Based Question Answering	Xiao Li, Yawei Sun, Gong Cheng			Scenario-based question answering (SQA) has attracted an increasing research interest. Compared with the well-studied machine reading comprehension (MRC), SQA is a more challenging task: a scenario may contain not only a textual passage to read but also structured data like tables, i.e., tabular scenario based question answering (TSQA). AI applications of TSQA such as answering multiple-choice questions in high-school exams require synthesizing data in multiple cells and combining tables with texts and domain knowledge to infer answers. To support the study of this task, we construct GeoTSQA. This dataset contains 1k real questions contextualized by tabular scenarios in the geography domain. To solve the task, we extend state-of-the-art MRC methods with TTGen, a novel table-to-text generator. It generates sentences from variously synthesized tabular data and feeds the downstream MRC method with the most useful sentences. Its sentence ranking model fuses the information in the scenario, question, and domain knowledge. Our approach outperforms a variety of strong baseline methods on GeoTSQA.

ICD code has shown its potentials in many fields, but manual coding is labor-intensive and error-prone, lead to researches of automatic coding. Two specific challenges of this task are 1) given an annotated clinical notes, the reasons behind specific diagnoses and treatments are lost; 2) explainability is important for practical automatic coding method, the method should not only explain its prediction output but also have explainable internal mechanics. This study aims to develop an explainable CNN approach to address these two challenges.	ICD coding |

Since the CORD-19 dataset is unlabeled, we have evaluated the question-answering models’ performance on two labeled questions answers datasets —CovidQA and CovidGQA. The BERT-based QA system achieved the highest F1 score (26.32), while the ALBERT-based QA system achieved the highest Exact Match (13.04). However, numerous challenges are associated with developing high-performance question-answering systems for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics. At the end of this paper, we discuss these challenges and suggest potential solutions to address them.

Here we propose a mechanism of the spin-memory loss. In contrast to other mechanisms based on interfacial spin-orbit coupling, our mechanism is based on the bulk spin-orbit coupling in a heavy-metal. We demonstrate that the bulk spin-orbit coupling induces the entanglement between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom and this spin-orbital entanglement can give rise to sizable spin-flip at the interface even when the interfacial spin-orbit coupling is weak. Our mechanism emphasizes crucial roles of the atomic orbital degree of freedom and induces the strong spin-memory loss near band crossing points between bands of different orbital characters.

Hoessly	ICMM Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas E-28049 Madrid Spain		The COVID-19 pandemic has had worldwide devastating effects on human lives, highlighting the need for tools to predict its development. The dynamics of such public-health threats can often be efficiently analysed through simple models that help to make quantitative timely policy decisions. We benchmark a minimal version of a Susceptible-Infected-Removed model for infectious diseases (SIR) coupled with a simple least-squares Statistical Heuristic Regression (SHR) based on a lognormal distribution. We derive the three free parameters for both models in several cases and test them against the amount of data needed to bring accuracy in predictions. The SHR model isaccurate about 20 days past the second inflexion point in the daily curve of cases, while the SIR model reaches a similar accuracy a fortnight before. All the analysed cases assert the utility of SHR and SIR approximants as a valuable tool to forecast the disease’s evolution. Finally, we have studied simulated stochastic individual-based SIR dynamics, which yields a detailed spatial and temporal view of the disease that cannot be given by SIR or SHR methods.

Asensio Ramos	institutetext:	hsocas@iac.es andres.asensio@iac.es	We have developed an inversion procedure designed for high-resolution solar spectro-polarimeters, such as Hinode/SP or DKIST/ViSP. The procedure is based on artificial neural networks trained with profiles generated from random atmospheric stratifications for a high generalization capability. When applied to Hinode data we find a hot fine-scale network structure whose morphology changes with height. In the middle layers this network resembles what is observed in G-band filtergrams but it is not identical. Surprisingly, the temperature enhancements in the middle and upper photosphere have a reversed pattern. Hot pixels in the middle photosphere, possibly associated to small-scale magnetic elements, appear cool at the=andlevel, and viceversa. Finally, we find hot arcs on the limb side of magnetic pores, which we interpret as the first direct observational evidence of the ”hot wall” effect in temperature.

It was found that advection of external field by a geometrically thin disk is rather inefficient, while the external weak field may be dragged inwards by fast radially moving tenuous or/and hot gas above the thin disk. We investigate the field advection in a thin (cold) accretion disk covered with hot corona, in which turbulence is responsible for the angular momentum transfer of the gas in the disk and corona. The radial velocity of the gas in the corona is significantly higher than that in the thin disk. Our calculations show that the external magnetic flux is eﬀiciently transported inwards by the corona, and the field line is strongly inclined towards the disk surface, which help launching outflows. The field configurations are consistent with those observed in the numerical simulations. The strength of the field is substantially enhanced in the inner region of the disk (usually several orders of magnitude higher than the external field strength), which is able to drive a fraction of gas in the corona into outflows. This mechanism may be useful in explaining the observational features in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. Our results may help understanding the physics of the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations.	accretion | accretion disks — galaxies: jets —ISM: jets and outflows — magnetic fields

Lentz	Friedrich-Loeffler-InstitutInstitute of EpidemiologySüdufer 10 17493 Greifswald GermanyInstitute of Physics Humboldt University of BerlinNewtonstraße 15 12489 BerlinIRIS Adlershof Zum Großen Windkanal 6 12489 Berlin Germany		In, West Nile Virus (WNV) was detected for the first time in Germany. Since the first detection, 36 human cases and 175 cases in horses and birds are detected. The transmission cycle of West Nile Virus includes birds and mosquitoes and – as dead-end hosts – people and horses. Spatial dissemination of the disease is caused by the movements of birds and mosquitoes. While the activity and movement of mosquitoes are depending mainly on temperature, in the birds there is a complex movement pattern caused by local birds and long range dispersal birds. To this end, we have developed a metapopulation network model framework to delineate the potential spatial distribution and spread of WNV across Germany as well as to evaluate the risk throughout our proposed network model. Our model facilitates the interconnection amongst the vector, local birds and long range dispersal birds contact networks. We have assumed different distance dispersal kernels models for the vector and avian populations with the intention to include short and long range dispersal. The model includes spatial variation of mosquito abundance and the movements to resemble the reality.	SEIR | Network | Metapopulation | WNV | Spatial

The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific Oline at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.

Chakraborty Mukesh Sharma Bhaskar Vijay		vijay.2@iitj.ac.in debarati.earth@gmail.com sharma.15@iitj.ac.in	A novel concept of vision-based intelligent control of robotic arms is developed here in this work. This work enables the controlling of robotic arms motion only with visual inputs, that is, controlling by showing the videos of correct movements. This work can broadly be sub-divided into two segments. The first part of this work is to develop an unsupervised vision-based method to control robotic arm in 2-D plane, and the second one is with deep CNN in the same task in 3-D plane. The first method is unsupervised, where our aim is to perform mimicking of human arm motion in real-time by a manipulator. Mimicking, here involves a series of steps, namely, tracking the motion of the arm in videos, estimating motion parameters, and replicating the motion parameters in the robot. We developed a network, namely the vision-to-motion optical network (DON), where the input should be a video stream containing hand movements of human, the the output would be out the velocity and torque information of the hand movements shown in the videos. The output information of the DON is then fed to the robotic arm by enabling it to generate motion according to the real hand videos. The method has been tested with both live-stream video feed as well as on recorded video obtained from a monocular camera. Besides, the DON also enables a method to behave intelligently by predicting the trajectory of human hand even if the hand gets occluded for some time with varying degree of occlusion. This is why the mimicry of the arm incorporates some intelligence to it and becomes intelligent mimic (i- mimic). Alongside the unsupervised method another method has also been developed deploying the deep neural network technique with CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to perform the mimicking, where labelled datasets are used for training. The same dataset, as used in the unsupervised DON-based method, is used in the deep CNN method, after manual annotations. Both the proposed methods are validated with off-line as well as with on-line video datasets in real-time, enabling the robotic arm in ’i- mimic’ and thereby showing the effectiveness of the proposed method. The entire methodology is validated with real-time 1-link and simulated n-link manipulators alongwith suitable comparisons.

[2101.11453] Meta Adversarial Training against Universal Patches	Jan Hendrik Metzen Nicole Finnie Robin Hutmacher			Recently demonstrated physical-world adversarial attacks have exposed vulnerabilities in perception systems that pose severe risks for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. These attacks place adversarial artifacts in the physical world that indirectly cause the addition of a universal patch to inputs of a model that can fool it in a variety of contexts. Adversarial training is the most effective defense against image-dependent adversarial attacks. However, tailoring adversarial training to universal patches is computationally expensive since the optimal universal patch depends on the model weights which change during training. We propose meta adversarial training (MAT), a novel combination of adversarial training with meta-learning, which overcomes this challenge by meta-learning universal patches along with model training. MAT requires little extra computation while continuously adapting a large set of patches to the current model. MAT considerably increases robustness against universal patch attacks on image classification and traffic-light detection.

Wang, T.-F. Zhang, and C. Liu,J. Non-Newton. Fluid Mech.293 (2021), 104559, 13 pp], by using the energetic variational approach. The model couples the breaking/reforming reaction scheme of the microscopic polymers with other mechanical effects in usual viscoelastic complex fluids. We establish the global existence of classical solutions near the global equilibrium, in which the treatment on the chemo-mechanical coupling effect is the most crucial part. In particular, a weighted Poincaré inequality with a mean value is employed to overcome the difficulty that arises from the non-conservative number density distribution of each species.	Keywords

[2101.11459] Piecewise Non-Linearity and Capacitance in the Joint Density Functional Theory of Extended Interfaces	Tobias Binninger	Univ. Montpellier CNRS ENSCM Montpellier France	tobias.binninger.science@gmx.de	Theab initiosimulation of charged interfaces in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) is heavily employed for the study of electrochemical energy conversion processes. The capacitance is the primary descriptor for the response of the electrochemical interface. It is essentially equal to the inverse of the energy curvature as a function of electron number, and as such there appears a conflict with the fundamental principle of piecewise linearity in DFT that requires the energy curvature to be zero at fractional electron numbers,i.e.almost everywhere. To resolve this conflict, we derive an exact expression between the energy curvature and the Kohn-Sham density of states, the local density of states, and the Fukui potential. We find that the piecewise linearity requirement does not hold for the volume- or area-specific energy of extended systems and surfaces. Applied to the joint density functional theory of an electrode–electrolyte interface, including the ionic and dielectric response of the electrolyte, the same expression represents a rigorous basis for the partitioning of the total interfacial capacitance into contributions of the quantum capacitance, space-charge capacitance, and electrochemical double-layer capacitance. It provides insight into the influence of the electrode material, thickness, and temperature on the charging characteristics, as demonstrated by results for a bulk gold electrode, a single-layer gold electrode, and a single-layer graphene electrode.

In particular, we consider ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter based estimates based upon several nonlinear Kalman-Bucy diffusions. Based upon new conditional bias results for the mean of the afore-mentioned methods, we analyze the empirical log-scale normalization constants in terms of theirerrors and conditional bias. Depending on the type of nonlinear Kalman-Bucy diffusion, we show that these are of orderor(errors) and of orderor(conditional bias), whereis the time horizon andis the ensemble size. Finally, we use these results for online static parameter estimation for above filtering models and implement the methodology for both linear and nonlinear models.Keywords: Kalman-Bucy filter, Riccati equations, nonlinear Markov processes.

In addition to fundamental questions about the moral agency of these systems, behavioral issues arise. This article focuses on the responsibility of agents who decide on our behalf. We investigate the empirically accessible question of whether the production of moral outcomes by an agent is systematically judged differently when the agent is artificial and not human. The results of a laboratory experiment suggest that decision-makers can actually rid themselves of guilt more easily by delegating to machines than by delegating to other people. Our results imply that the availability of artificial agents could provide stronger incentives for decision makers to delegate morally sensitive decisions.

However, CNNs can easily be fooled by adversarial examples, i.e., maliciously-crafted images that force the networks to predict an incorrect output while being extremely similar to those for which a correct output is predicted. Regular adversarial examples are not robust to input image transformations, which can then be used to detect whether an adversarial example is presented to the network. Nevertheless, it is still possible to generate adversarial examples that are robust to such transformations.	adversarial examples | adversarial defense | input transformation | deep neural network | convolutional neural network | redundant neural networks
[2101.11467] Fluid dynamics in the warp drive spacetime geometry	Osvaldo L. Santos-Pereira Everton M. C. Abreu Marcelo B. Ribeiro	Institute Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro Brazil	evertonabreu@ufrrj.br mbr@if.ufrj.br olsp@if.ufrj.br	The Alcubierre warp drive metric is a spacetime geometry featuring a spacetime distortion, called warp bubble, where a massive particle inside it acquires global superluminal velocities, or warp speeds. This work presents solutions of the Einstein equations for the Alcubierre metric having fluid matter as gravity source. The energy-momentum tensor considered two fluid contents, the perfect fluid and the parametrized perfect fluid (PPF), a tentative more flexible model whose aim is to explore the possibilities of warp drive solutions with positive matter density content. Santos-Pereira et al. (2020) already showed that the Alcubierre metric having dust as source connects this geometry to the Burgers equation, which describes shock waves moving through an inviscid fluid, but led the solutions back to vacuum. The same happened for two out of four solutions subcases for the perfect fluid. Other solutions for the perfect fluid indicate the possibility of warp drive with positive matter density, but at the cost of a complex solution for the warp drive regulating function. Regarding the PPF, solutions were also obtained indicating that warp speeds could be created with positive matter density. Weak, dominant, strong and null energy conditions were calculated for all studied subcases, being satisfied for the perfect fluid and creating constraints in the PPF quantities such that positive matter density is also possible for creating a warp bubble. Summing up all results, energy-momentum tensors describing more complex forms of matter, or field, distributions generate solutions for the Einstein equations with the warp drive metric where negative matter density might not be a strict precondition for attaining warp speeds.	warp drive | cosmic fluid | Burgers equation | shock waves | Alcubierre geometry

We show that when (i) all data has some idiosyncratic missingness and (ii) the number of variables grows superlogarithmically in, then, for large, listwise deletion will drop all rows with probability 1.

Conraths Igor M. Sokolov Hartmut H. K.

Ticks belonging to the genusHyalommaare the main vectors and reservoir for the virus. It is maintained in nature in an endemic vertebrate-tick-vertebrate cycle. CCHFV is prevalent in wide geographical areas including Asia, Africa, South-Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Over the last decade, several outbreaks of CCHFV have been observed in Europe, mainly in Mediterranean countries. Due to the high case/fatality ratio of CCHFV in human sometimes, it is of great importance for public health. Climate change and the invasion of CCHFV vectors in Central Europe suggest that the establishment of the transmission in Central Europe may be possible in future.

[2101.11473] Formulating and solving integrated order batching and routing in multi-depot AGV-assisted mixed-shelves warehouses	Lin Xie Hanyi Li Laurin Luttmann		xie@leuphana.de	Different retail and e-commerce companies are facing the challenge of assembling large numbers of time-critical picking orders that include both small-line and multi-line orders. To reduce unproductive picker working time as in traditional picker-to-parts warehousing systems, different solutions are proposed in the literature and in practice. For example, in a mixed-shelves storage policy, items of the same stock keeping unit are spread over several shelves in a warehouse; or automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are used to transport the picked items from the storage area to packing stations instead of human pickers. This is the first paper to combine both solutions, creating what we callAGV-assisted mixed-shelves picking systems. We model the new integrated order batching and routing problem in such systems as an extended multi-depot vehicle routing problem with both three-index and two-commodity network flow formulations. Due to the complexity of the integrated problem, we develop a novel variable neighborhood search algorithm to solve the integrated problem more efficiently. We test our methods with different sizes of instances, and conclude that the mixed-shelves storage policy is more suitable than the usual storage policy in AGV-assisted mixed-shelves systems for orders with different sizes of order lines (saving up to 62% on driving distances for AGVs). Our variable neighborhood search algorithm provides optimal solutions within an acceptable computational time.	Logistics | Order batching | Routing | Mixed-shelves storage | AGV-assisted picking

Wimmer	thanks:	taumann@ikp.tu-darmstadt.de	The proton drip-line nucleusNe is investigated experimentally in order to determine its two-proton halo character. A fully exclusive measurement of theNeFOquasi-free one-proton knockout reaction has been performed at GSI at around 500 MeV/nucleon beam energy. All particles resulting from the scattering process have been detected. The relevant reconstructed quantities are the angles of the two protons scattered in qusi-elastic kinematics, the decay ofF intoO (includingdecays from excited states) and a proton, as well as theOrelative-energy spectrum and theF momentum distributions. The latter two quantities allow an independent and consistent determination of the ratio ofandmotion of the valence protons inNe. With a resulting relatively smallcomponent of only around 35(3)%, it is concluded thatNe exhibits a rather modest halo character only. The quantitative agreement of the two values deduced from the energy spectrum and the momentum distributions supports the theoretical treatment of the calculation of momentum distributions after quasi-free knockout reactions at high energies by taking into account distortions based on the Glauber theory. Moreover, the experimental data allow the separation of valence-proton knockout and knockout from theO core. The latter process contributes with 11.8(3.1) mb around 40% to the total proton-knockout cross section of 30.3(2.3) mb, which explains previously reported contradicting conclusions derived from inclusive cross sections.	
[2101.11475] Improved Wall-Normal Derivative Formulae for Anisotropic Adaptive Simplex-Element Grids	Hiroaki NishikawaNational Institute of Aerospace, Hampton, VA 23666, USA	Research Fellow 100 Exploration Way Hampton VA 23666 USA Associate Fellow AIAA	hiro@nianet.org	In this paper, we explore methods for computing wall-normal derivatives used for calculating wall skin friction and heat transfer over a solid wall in unstructured simplex-element (triangular/tetrahedral) grids generated by anisotropic grid adaptation. Simplex-element grids are considered as efficient and suitable for automatic grid generation and adaptation, but present a challenge to accurately predict wall-normal derivatives. For example, wall-normal derivatives computed by a simple finite-difference approximation, as typically done in practical fluid-dynamics simulation codes, are often contaminated with numerical noise. To address this issue, we propose an improved method based on a common step-length for the finite-difference approximation, which is otherwise random due to grid irregularity and thus expected to smooth the wall-normal derivative distribution over a boundary. Also, we consider using least-squares gradients to compute the wall-normal derivatives and discuss their possible improvements. Numerical results show that the improved methods greatly reduce the noise in the wall-normal derivatives for irregular simplex-element grids.	
[2101.11476] Utilizing uncertainty estimation in deep learning segmentation of fluorescence microscopy images with missing markers				Fluorescence microscopy images contain several channels, each indicating a marker staining the sample. Since many different marker combinations are utilized in practice, it has been challenging to apply deep learning based segmentation models, which expect a predefined channel combination for all training samples as well as at inference for future application. Recent work circumvents this problem using a modality attention approach to be effective across any possible marker combination. However, for combinations that do not exist in a labeled training dataset, one cannot have any estimation of potential segmentation quality if that combination is encountered during inference. Without this, not only one lacks quality assurance but one also does not know where to put any additional imaging and labeling effort. We herein propose a method to estimate segmentation quality on unlabeled images by () estimating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties of convolutional neural networks for image segmentation, and () training a Random Forest model for the interpretation of uncertainty features via regression to their corresponding segmentation metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate that including these uncertainty measures during training can provide an improvement on segmentation performance.

Guimarães Jean-François Filipot Fabien Leckler Rui Duarte	France Energies Marines Plouzané 29280 	Caio.Stringari@france-energies-marines.com	Wave breaking is an important process for energy dissipation in the open ocean and coastal seas. It drives beach morphodynamics, controls air-sea interactions, determines when ship and offshore structure operations can occur safely, and influences on the retrieval of ocean properties from satellites. Still, wave breaking lacks a proper physical understanding mainly due to scarce observational field data. Consequently, new methods and data are required to improve our current understanding of this process. In this paper we present a novel machine learning method to detect active wave breaking, that is, waves that are actively generating visible bubble entrainment in video imagery data. The present method is based on classical machine learning and deep learning techniques and is made freely available to the community alongside this publication. The results indicate that our best performing model had a balanced classification accuracy score of90% when classifying active wave breaking in the test dataset. An example of a direct application of the method includes a statistical description of geometrical and kinematic properties of breaking waves. We expect that the present method and the associated dataset will be crucial for future research related to wave breaking in several areas of research, which include but are not limited to: improving operational forecast models, developing risk assessment and coastal management tools, and refining the retrieval of remotely sensed ocean properties.

Time series analyses unveil the presence of two periods, the dominant with a period ofhr, which might be attributed to the spin of the white dwarf, and a secondary ofhr that is in line with the orbital period of the binary system derived from optical observations. We do not detect extended X-ray emission as in other nova shells probably due to its relatively old age (130–170 yr) or to its asymmetric disrupted morphology which is suggestive of explosion scenarios different to the symmetric ones assumed in available numerical simulations of nova explosions.

The connection between the power delivered by the QDM and quantum coherence is not simply proportional but depends on an interplay between the interdot coherent tunneling, the interaction of the system with thermal phonon reservoirs, and the resonance between the QDM and conduction bands. We explored numerically various parameter regimes and found that the maximum power delivered by the molecule is up to 30% greater than the power delivered by a single quantum-dot device. The calculated photovoltaic conversion efficiency is presented in terms of accessible experimental parameters and, as expected, is constrained by the second law.

[2101.11490] Non-Asymptotic Converse Bounds Via Auxiliary Channels	Ioannis Papoutsidakis, Robert J. Piechocki, and Angela Doufexi	Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering University of BristolEmail: {ioannis.papoutsidakis r.j.piechocki 		This paper presents a new derivation method of converse bounds on the non-asymptotic achievable rate of discrete weakly symmetric memoryless channels. It is based on the finite blocklength statistics of the channel, where with the use of an auxiliary channel the converse bound is produced. This method is general and initially is presented for an arbitrary weakly symmetric channel. Afterwards, the main result is specialized for the-ary erasure channel (QEC), binary symmetric channel (BSC), and QEC with stop feedback. Numerical evaluations show identical or comparable bounds to the state-of-the-art in the cases of QEC and BSC, and a tighter bound for the QEC with stop feedback.

[2101.11492] On the Evolution of Syntactic Information Encoded by BERT’s Contextualized Representations	Laura Pérez-Mayos1, Roberto Carlini1, Miguel Ballesteros2, Leo Wanner3,11TALN Research Group, Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, Spain2Amazon AI3Catalan Institute for Research and Advanced Studies , Barcelona,		ballemig@amazon.com	The adaptation of pretrained language models to solve supervised tasks has become a baseline in NLP, and many recent works have focused on studying how linguistic information is encoded in the pretrained sentence representations. Among other information, it has been shown that entire syntax trees are implicitly embedded in the geometry of such models. As these models are often fine-tuned, it becomes increasingly important to understand how the encoded knowledge evolves along the fine-tuning. In this paper, we analyze the evolution of the embedded syntax trees along the fine-tuning process of BERT for six different tasks, covering all levels of the linguistic structure. Experimental results show that the encoded syntactic information is forgotten (PoS tagging), reinforced (dependency and constituency parsing) or preserved (semantics-related tasks) in different ways along the fine-tuning process depending on the task.

Wüstling			TheKArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino(KATRIN) experiment aims to measure the neutrino mass with a sensitivity of(CL). This will be achieved by a precision measurement of the endpoint region of the-electron spectrum of tritium decay. The-electrons are produced in theWindowless Gaseous Tritium Source(WGTS) and guided magnetically through the beamline. In order to accurately extract the neutrino mass the source activity is required to be stable and known to a high precision. The WGTS therefore undergoes constant extensive monitoring from several measurement systems. TheForward Beam Monitor(FBM) is one such monitoring system.

In Greek mythology, Themis, the ’goddess of justice’, has a sword in her right hand to protect society from vices, and a ’balance of judgment’ in her left hand that measures good and evil. In this study, we propose a fair distribution method ’utilising physics’ for the profit in games of characteristic function form. Specifically, we show that the linear programming problem for calculating ’nucleolus’ can be efficiently solved by considering it as a physical system in which gravity works. In addition to being able to significantly reduce computational complexity thereby, we believe that this system could have flexibility necessary to respond to real-time changes in the parameter.

The images cover 438 arcmin, which encompasses the entire complex, and were taken in the filters F110W, F139M, and F160W. We have estimated extinctions for individual sources in these data from their colors and have dereddened their photometry accordingly. By comparing an area of the images that contains the richest concentration of previously identified W3 members to an area that has few members and is dominated by background stars, we have estimated the luminosity function for members of W3 with masses of 0.03–0.4. That luminosity function closely resembles data in typical nearby star-forming regions that have much smaller stellar populations than W3 (500 vs. several thousand objects). Thus, we do not find evidence of significant variations in the initial mass function of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs with star-forming conditions, which is consistent with recent studies of other distant massive star-forming regions.

[2101.11500] A Deterministic Algorithm for the Discrete Logarithm Problem in a Semigroup	Simran Tinani Joachim Rosenthal	Institute of Mathematics University of Zurich Switzerland		The discrete logarithm problem in a finite group is the basis for many protocols in cryptography. The best general algorithms which solve this problem have time complexity of, and a space complexity ofwhereis the order of the group. (Ifis unknown, a simple modification would achieve a time complexity of.) These algorithms require the inversion of some group elements or rely on finding collisions and the existence of inverses, and thus do not adapt to work in the general semigroup setting. For semigroups, probabilistic algorithms with similar time complexity have been proposed. The main result of this paper is a deterministic algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem in a semigroup. Specifically, letbe an element in a semigroup having finite order. The paper provides an algorithm, which, given any element, provides all natural numberswith, and has time complexitysteps. The paper also gives an analysis of the success rates of the existing probabilistic algorithms, which were so far only conjectured or stated loosely.

Despite its fundamental importance, the distribution of entanglement over long distances through photons is unfortunately hindered by unavoidable decoherence effects. Entanglement distillation is a means of restoring the quality of such diluted entanglement by concentrating it into a pair of qubits. Conventionally, this would be done by distributing multiple photon pairs and distilling the entanglement into a single pair. Here, we turn around this paradigm by utilising pairs of single photons entangled in multiple degrees of freedom. Specifically, we make use of the polarisation and the energy-time domain of photons, both of which are extensively field-tested. We experimentally chart the domain of distillable states and achieve relative fidelity gains up to 13.8 %. Compared to the two-copy scheme, the distillation rate of our single-copy scheme is several orders of magnitude higher, paving the way towards high-capacity and noise-resilient quantum networks.

Heizler		avnerco@gmail.com	We study the propagation of radiative heat (Marshak) waves, using modified-approximation equations. In relatively optically-thin media the heat propagation is supersonic, i.e. hydrodynamic motion is negligible, and thus can be described by the radiative transfer Boltzmann equation, coupled with the material energy equation. However, the exact thermal radiative transfer problem is still difficult to solve and requires massive simulation capabilities. Hence, there still exists a need for adequate approximations that are comparatively easy to carry out. Classic approximations, such as the classic diffusion and classic, fail to describe the correct heat wave velocity, when the optical depth is not sufficiently high. Therefore, we use the recently developed discontinuous asymptoticapproximation, which is a time-dependent analogy for the adjustment of the discontinuous asymptotic diffusion for two different zones. This approximation was tested via several benchmarks, showing better results than other common approximations, and has also demonstrated a good agreement with a main Marshak wave experiment and its Monte-Carlo gray simulation. Here we derive energy expansion of the discontinuous asymptoticapproximation in slab geometry, and test it with numerous experimental results for propagating Marshak waves inside low density foams. The new approximation describes the heat wave propagation with good agreement. Furthermore, a comparison of the simulations to exact implicit Monte-Carlo slab-geometry multi-group simulations, in this wide range of experimental conditions, demonstrates the superiority of this approximation to others.

We first systematically compare the results of an Alfvén wave (AW) driven wind model with a polytropic approach. Polytropic magnetohydrodynamic wind models are thermally driven, while Alfvén waves act as additional acceleration and heating mechanisms in the Alfvén wave driven model. We confirm that an AW-driven model is required to reproduce the observed bimodality of slow and fast solar winds. We are also able to reproduce the observed anti-correlation between the terminal wind velocity and the coronal source temperature with the AW-driven wind model. We also show that the wind properties along an eleven year cycle differ significantly from one model to the other. The AW-driven model again shows the best agreement with observational data. Indeed, solar surface magnetic field topology plays an important role in the Alfvén wave driven wind model, as it enters directly into the input energy sources via the Poynting flux. On the other hand, the polytropic wind model is driven by an assumed pressure gradient; thus it is relatively less sensitive to the surface magnetic field topology. Finally, we note that the net torque spinning down the Sun exhibits the same trends in the two models, showing that the polytropic approach still captures correctly the essence of stellar winds.

These algebras generalize cancellative dimer algebras on a torus to higher genus surfaces, where the relations come from perfect matchings rather than a potential. Although cancellative dimer algebras on a torus are noncommutative crepant resolutions, the center of any dimer algebra on a higher genus surface is just the polynomial ring in one variable, and so the center and surface are unrelated. In contrast, we establish a rich interplay between the central geometry of geodesic ghor algebras and the topology of the surface in which they are embedded. Furthermore, we show that noetherian central localizations of such algebras are endomorphism rings of modules over their centers.

A common tactic in this regard is to rely on reduced-order models. Such approaches, in general, use measurement data of a one-time instance. However, often data available from sensors is sequential, and ignoring it results in information loss. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based state estimation framework that learns from sequential data. The proposed model structure consists of the recurrent cell to pass information from different time steps, enabling this information to recover the full state. We illustrate that utilizing sequential data allows for state recovery from minimal and noisy sensor measurements. For efficient recovery of the state, the proposed approach is coupled with an auto-encoder based reduced-order model. We illustrate the performance of the proposed approach using three examples, and it is found to outperform other alternatives existing in the literature.

Furthermore, a usage of a single shortest paths (for routing) implies possible traffic bottleneck, which should be avoided if possible, which we termpathneck security avoidance. Finding all Pareto–optimal solutions for the multi-criteria single-source single-destination shortest secure path problem with non-negative edge lengths might yield a solution with an exponential number of paths. In the first part of this paper, we study specific settings of the multi-criteria shortest secure path problem, which are based on prioritized multi-criteria and on-shortest secure paths. In the second part, we show a polynomial-time algorithm that, given an undirected graphand a pair of vertices, finds prioritized multi-criteria-disjoint (vertex/edge) shortest secure paths betweenand. In the third part of the paper, we introduce the-disjoint all-criteria-shortest secure paths problem, which is solved in time.

Holzapfel	Corresponding author email address:	tillmann.wiegold@tu-dortmund.de	The present study focuses on the receptor driven endocytosis typical of viral entry into a cell. A locally increased density of receptors at the time of contact between the cell and the virus is necessary in this case. The virus is considered as a substrate with fixed receptors on its surface, whereas the receptors of the host cell are free to move over its membrane, allowing a local change in their concentration. In the contact zone the membrane inflects and forms an envelope around the virus. The created vesicle imports its cargo into the cell. This paper assumes the diffusion equation accompanied by boundary conditions requiring the conservation of binders to describe the process. Moreover, it introduces a condition defining the energy balance at the front of the adhesion zone. The latter yields the upper limit for the size of virus which can be engulfed by the cell membrane. The described moving boundary problem in terms of the binder density and the velocity of the adhesion front is well posed and numerically solved by using the finite difference method. The illustrative examples have been chosen to show the influence of the process parameters on the initiation and the duration of the process.	Keywords

BLO is able to handle problems with a hierarchical structure, involving two levels of optimization tasks, where one task is nested inside the other. In machine learning and computer vision fields, despite the different motivations and mechanisms, a lot of complex problems, such as hyper-parameter optimization, multi-task and meta learning, neural architecture search, adversarial learning and deep reinforcement learning, actually all contain a series of closely related subproblms. In this paper, we first uniformly express these complex learning and vision problems from the perspective of BLO. Then we construct a best-response-based single-level reformulation and establish a unified algorithmic framework to understand and formulate mainstream gradient-based BLO methodologies, covering aspects ranging from fundamental automatic differentiation schemes to various accelerations, simplifications, extensions and their convergence and complexity properties. Last but not least, we discuss the potentials of our unified BLO framework for designing new algorithms and point out some promising directions for future research.

This situation shows that a classification of simple Hom-Lie algebras would be unrealistic without any further restrictions. We introduce the class ofstrongly simple Hom-Lie algebras, as the class of anticommutative algebras that are simple Hom-Lie with respect to all their twisting maps. We show some of its properties, provide a characterization and explore some of its subclasses. Furthermore, we provide a complete classification of regular simple Hom-Lie algebras over any arbitrary field, together with a description of a lower bound of the number of their isomorphism classes, which depends entirely on the finiteness or not of the underlying field. In addition, we establish that every simple anticommutative algebra of dimensionturns out to be the outside Yau’s twist of the special orthogonal Lie algebrawith respect to some bijective linear map. Also, we determine all the simple Hom-Lie algebras of dimension, up to conjugacy, which were wrongly claimed to be nonexistent in previous literature. Finally, we establish a newsimplicity criterionfor Lie algebras, which as an application shows that the simplicity in the category of multiplicative Hom-Lie algebras is equivalent to that of anticommutative algebras.

[2101.11519] Pregeometry and spontaneous time-space asymmetry	C. Wetterich	Institut für Theoretische PhysikUniversität HeidelbergPhilosophenweg 16 D-69120 Heidelberg		In pregeometry a metric arises as a composite object at large distances. We investigate if its signature, which distinguishes between time and space, could be a result of the dynamics rather than being built in already in the formulation of a model. For short distances we formulate our model as a Yang-Mills theory with fermions and vector fields. For the local gauge symmetry we take the non-compact group SO(4,). The particular representation of the vector field permits us to implement diffeomorphism invariant kinetic terms. Geometry and general relativity emerge at large distances due to a spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry which induces masses for the gauge bosons. The difference between time and space arises directly from this spontaneous symmetry breaking. For a euclidean metric all fields have a standard propagator at high momenta. Analytic continuation to a Minkowski-metric is achieved by a change of field values. We conjecture that this type of model could be consistent with unitarity and well behaved in the short distance limit.	
[2101.11520] Supervised Tree-Wasserstein Distance	Yuki Takezawa Ryoma Sato Makoto Yamada			To measure the similarity of documents, the Wasserstein distance is a powerful tool, but it requires a high computational cost. Recently, for fast computation of the Wasserstein distance, methods for approximating the Wasserstein distance using a tree metric have been proposed. These tree-based methods allow fast comparisons of a large number of documents; however, they are unsupervised and do not learn task-specific distances. In this work, we propose the Supervised Tree-Wasserstein (STW) distance, a fast, supervised metric learning method based on the tree metric. Specifically, we rewrite the Wasserstein distance on the tree metric by the parent–child relationships of a tree, and formulate it as a continuous optimization problem using a contrastive loss. Experimentally, we show that the STW distance can be computed fast, and improves the accuracy of document classification tasks. Furthermore, the STW distance is formulated by matrix multiplications, runs on a GPU, and is suitable for batch processing. Therefore, we show that the STW distance is extremely efficient when comparing a large number of documents.	Machine Learning | ICML

Cascaded inverter will be designed and simulated to draw power from PV cells.

For unsupervised graph representation learning, many algorithms such as Node2Vec and GraphSAGE make use of “negative sampling” and/or noise contrastive estimation loss. This bears similar ideas to contrastive learning, which “contrasts” the node representation similarities of semantically similar (positive) pairs against those of negative pairs. However, despite the success of contrastive learning, we found that directly applying this technique to graph representation learning models (e.g., graph convolutional networks) does not always work. We theoretically analyze the generalization performance and propose a light-weight regularization term that avoids the high scales of node representations’ norms and the high variance among them to improve the generalization performance. Our experimental results further validate that this regularization term significantly improves the representation quality across different node similarity definitions and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

[2101.11527] Ergodicity breaking in area-restricted search of avian predators	Ohad Vilk Yotam Orchan Motti Charter Nadav Ganot Sivan Toledo Ran Nathan Michael Assaf		ohad.vilk@mail.huji.ac.il ran.nathan@mail.huji.ac.il michael.assaf@mail.huji.ac.il	Quantifying and comparing patterns of dynamical ecological systems require averaging over measurable quantities. For example, to infer variation in movement and behavior, metrics such as step length and velocity are averaged over large ensembles. Yet, in nonergodic systems such averaging is inconsistent; thus, identifying ergodicity breaking is essential in ecology. Using rich high-resolution movement datasets (localizations) from 70 individuals and continuous-time random walk modeling, we find subdiffusive behavior and ergodicity breaking in the localized movement of three species of avian predators. Small-scale, within-patch movement was found to be qualitatively different, not inferrable and separated from large-scale inter-patch movement. Local search is characterized by long power-law-distributed waiting times with diverging mean, giving rise to ergodicity breaking in the form of considerable variability uniquely observed at this scale. This implies that wild animal movement is scale specific with no typical waiting time at the local scale.

Despite this bottleneck, community’s efforts seem to be invested only in coming up with novel architectures. To specifically address this bottleneck, we introduce two new pose based human action datasets - NTU60-X and NTU120-X. Our datasets extend the largest existing action recognition dataset, NTU-RGBD. In addition to the 25 body joints for each skeleton as in NTU-RGBD, NTU60-X and NTU120-X dataset includes finger and facial joints, enabling a richer skeleton representation. We appropriately modify the state of the art approaches to enable training using the introduced datasets. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these NTU-X datasets in overcoming the aforementioned bottleneck and improve state of the art performance, overall and on previously worst performing action categories.

[2101.11530] SYNTACTICALLY GUIDED GENERATIVE EMBEDDINGS FOR ZERO-SHOT SKELETON ACTION RECOGNITION				We introduce SynSE, a novel syntactically guided generative approach for Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL). Our end-to-end approach learns progressively refined generative embedding spaces constrained within and across the involved modalities (visual, language). The inter-modal constraints are defined between action sequence embedding and embeddings of Parts of Speech (PoS) tagged words in the corresponding action description. We deploy SynSE for the task of skeleton-based action sequence recognition. Our design choices enable SynSE to generalize compositionally, i.e., recognize sequences whose action descriptions contain words not encountered during training. We also extend our approach to the more challenging Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) problem via a confidence-based gating mechanism. We are the first to present zero-shot skeleton action recognition results on the large-scale NTU-60 and NTU-120 skeleton action datasets with multiple splits. Our results demonstrate SynSE’s state of the art performance in both ZSL and GZSL settings compared to strong baselines on the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets.

One such species is phenylpropiolonitrile (3-phenyl-2-propynenitrile,\ceC6H5C3N), whose spectroscopic characterization is reported here for the first time. The low resolution (0.5 cm) vibrational spectrum of\ceC6H5C3N has been recorded at far- and mid-infrared wavelengths (50–3500 cm) using a Fourier Transform interferometer, allowing for the assignment of band centers of 14 fundamental vibrational bands. The pure rotational spectrum of the species has been investigated using a chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (FTMW) spectrometer (6–18 GHz), a cavity enhanced FTMW instrument (6–20 GHz), and a millimeter-wave one (75–100 GHz, 140–214 GHz). Through the assignment of more than 6200 lines, accurate ground state spectroscopic constants (rotational, centrifugal distortion up to octics, and nuclear quadrupole hyperfine constants) have been derived from our measurements, with a plausible prediction of the weaker bands through calculations. Interstellar searches for this highly polar species can now be undertaken with confidence since the astronomically most interesting radio lines have either been measured or can be calculated to very high accuracy below 300 GHz.	pure rotation | vibration | astrophysical species | PAH derivative | phenylpropiolonitrile

[2101.11536] Tractable higher-order under-approximating AE extensions for non-linear systems	Eric Goubault Sylvie Putot	LIX CNRS Ecole Polytechnique Institut Polytechnique de Paris France (email:	author@lix.polytechnique.fr	We consider the problem of under and over-approximating the image of general vector-valued functions over bounded sets, and apply the proposed solution to the estimation of reachable sets of uncertain non-linear discrete-time dynamical systems. Such a combination of under and over-approximations is very valuable for the verification of properties of embedded and cyber-physical controlled systems. Over-approximations prove properties correct, while under-approximations can be used for falsification. Coupled, they provide a measure of the conservatism of the analysis. This work introduces a general framework relying on computations of robust ranges of vector-valued functions. This framework allows us to extend for under-approximation many precision refinements that are classically used for over-approximations, such as affine approximations, Taylor models, quadrature formulae and preconditioning methods. We end by evaluating the efficiency and precision of our approach, focusing on the application to the analysis of discrete-time dynamical systems with inputs and disturbances, on different examples from the literature.

[2101.11539] Autoencoder-based Condition Monitoring and Anomaly Detection Method for Rotating Machines	Sabtain Ahmad, Kevin Styp-Rekowski, Sasho Nedelkoski, Odej Kao	Distributed and Operating SystemsTU BerlinBerlin 	s.ahmad@campus.tu-berlin.de	Rotating machines like engines, pumps, or turbines are ubiquitous in modern day societies. Their mechanical parts such as electrical engines, rotors, or bearings are the major components and any failure in them may result in their total shutdown. Anomaly detection in such critical systems is very important to monitor the system’s health. As the requirement to obtain a dataset from rotating machines where all possible faults are explicitly labeled is difficult to satisfy, we propose a method that focuses on the normal behavior of the machine instead. We propose an autoencoder model-based method for condition monitoring of rotating machines by using an anomaly detection approach. The method learns the characteristics of a rotating machine using the normal vibration signals to model the healthy state of the machine. A threshold-based approach is then applied to the reconstruction error of unseen data, thus enabling the detection of unseen anomalies. The proposed method can directly extract the salient features from raw vibration signals and eliminate the need for manually engineered features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by employing two rotating machine datasets and the quality of the automatically learned features is compared with a set of handcrafted features by training an Isolation Forest model on either of these two sets. Experimental results on two real-world datasets indicate that our proposed solution gives promising results, achieving an average F1-score of 99.6%.

Based on the cumulative flux distribution of the-ray lightcurve, we identified four distinct activity states and noticed an increase in the baseline flux during the first three states. Similar nature of the increase in the average flux was also noticed in X-ray and UV bands. A large flaring activity in-rays was noticed in the fourth state. The source was observed twice byAstroSatfor shorter intervals (days) during the longer observing periods (years) state 3 and 4. DuringAstroSatobserving periods, the source-ray flux was higher than the average flux observed during longer duration states. The increase in the average baseline flux from state 1 to state 3 can be explained considering a corresponding increase of jet particle normalisation. The inverse Comptonisation of synchrotron photons explained the average X-ray and-ray emission by jet electrons during the first three longer duration states. However, during the shorter durationAstroSatobserving periods, a shift of the synchrotron peak frequency was noticed, and the synchrotron emission of jet electrons well explained the observed X-ray flux.	galaxies: active — galaxies: jets — gamma-rays: galaxies — X-rays: galaxies—quasar: individual (NGC 1275)

[2101.11543] Linear Polarization of the 21 cm Line from the Epoch of Reionization	Bohua Li Jianrong Tan Yi Mao	Department of Astronomy Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 China		The 21 cm linear polarization due to Thomson scattering off free electrons can probe the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium during the epoch of reionization, complementary to the 21 cm temperature fluctuations. Previous study(2005ApJ...635....1B)estimated the strength of polarization with a toy model and claimed that it can be detected with 1-month observation of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Here we revisit this investigation with account of nonlinear terms due to inhomogeneous reionization, using seminumerical reionization simulations to provide the realistic estimation of the 21 cm TE and EE angular power spectra (and). We find that (1) both power spectra are enhanced on sub-bubble scales but suppressed on super-bubble scales, compared with previous results; (2)displays a zero-crossing at, and its angular scale is sensitive to the scale-dependence of HIbias on large scales; (3) the ratios of the power spectrum to its maximum value during reionization at a given, i.e.and, show robust correlations with the global ionized fraction. However, measurement of this signal will be very challenging not only because the overall strength is weaker than the sensitivity of SKA, but also because of the polarized foregrounds from diffuse synchrotron emission, and Faraday rotation which modifies the observed polarization. Nevertheless, the 21 cm linear polarization signal may still likely be detectable through other approaches, e.g. its cross-correlation with other probes.

Such operators arise as time-varying linear systems for example in radar and wireless communications. In particular, for information transmission in highly non-stationary environments the channel needs to be estimated quickly with identification signals of short duration and for vehicular application simultaneous high-resolution radar is desired as well. We consider the time-continuous setting and prove an exact resampling reformulation of the involved channel operator when applied to a trigonometric polynomial as identifier in terms of sparse linear combinations of real-valued atoms. Motivated by recent works of Heckel et al. we present an exact approach for off-the-grid superresolution which allows to perform the identification with realizable signals having compact support. Then we show how an alternating descent conditional gradient algorithm can be adapted to solve the reformulated problem. Numerical examples demonstrate the performance of this algorithm, in particular in comparison with a simple adaptive grid refinement strategy and an orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm.Key words and phrases: super-resolution, channel estimation, doubly-dispersive, time-frequency, sampling2010 AMS Mathematics Subject Classification— 47A62, 65R30, 65T99, 94A20	Key words and phrases

In particular, non-thermal HXR emissions from the solar corona are important because they are emitted near energy-release sites just after acceleration. In many flares, HXR sources at footpoints of magnetic-loop structures are prominent compared to coronal sources(Krucker et al.,2008). Therefore, it is challenging to observe weak HXR sources in the corona, with stronger HXR sources that are relatively near.

Various characteristics of UK horticultural production, notably labour reliance and import dependence, make it an important sector for policymakers concerned to understand the effects of these disruptive events as we move from 2020 into 2021. The study design prioritised timeliness, using a rapid survey to gather information from a relatively small () but indicative group of producers. The main novelty of the results is to suggest that a very substantial majority of producers either plan to scale back production in 2021 (47%) or have been unable to make plans for 2021 because of uncertainty (37%). The results also add to broader evidence that the sector has experienced profound labour supply challenges, with implications for labour cost and quality. The study discusses the implications of these insights from producers in terms of productivity and automation, as well as in terms of broader economic implications. Although automation is generally recognised as the long-term future for the industry (89%), it appeared in the study as the second most referred short-term option (32%) only after changes to labour schemes and policies (58%). Currently, automation plays a limited role in contributing to the UK’s horticultural workforce shortage due to economic and socio-political uncertainties. The conclusion highlights policy recommendations and future investigative intentions, as well as suggesting methodological and other discussion points for the research community.

The kernel libraries consist of infrastructures for building efficient GNNs, including graph data structures, graph map-reduce framework, graph mini-batch strategy, etc. These infrastructures enable tf_geometric to support single-graph computation, multi-graph computation, graph mini-batch, distributed training, etc.; therefore, tf_geometric can be used for a variety of graph deep learning tasks, such as transductive node classification, inductive node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. Based on the kernel libraries, tf_geometric implements a variety of popular GNN models for different tasks. To facilitate the implementation of GNNs, tf_geometric also provides some other libraries for dataset management, graph sampling, etc. Different from existing popular GNN libraries, tf_geometric provides not only Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) APIs, but also Functional APIs, which enable tf_geometric to handle advanced graph deep learning tasks such as graph meta-learning. The APIs of tf_geometric are friendly, and they are suitable for both beginners and experts. In this paper, we first present an overview of tf_geometric’s framework. Then, we conduct experiments on some benchmark datasets and report the performance of several popular GNN models implemented by tf_geometric.

We show that the thermal machine features a number of Liouvillian exceptional points (EPs) for experimentally realistic parameters, in particular a third-order exceptional point that leaves signatures both in short and long-time regimes. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this EP corresponds to a regime of critical decay for the quantum thermal machine towards its steady state, bearing a striking resemblance with a critically damped harmonic oscillator. These results open up exciting possibilities for the precise dynamical control of quantum thermal machines exploiting exceptional points from non-Hermitian physics and are amenable to state-of-the-art solid-state platforms such as semiconducting and superconducting devices.

Research VerizonMedia New	shaunakm@verizonmedia.com	Community question answering and discussion platforms such as Reddit, Yahoo! answers or Quora provide users the flexibility of asking open ended questions to a large audience, and replies to such questions maybe useful both to the user and the community on certain topics such as health, sports or finance. Given the recent events around COVID-19, some of these platforms have attracted 2000+ questions from users about several aspects associated with the disease. Given the impact of this disease on general public, in this work we investigate ways to improve the ranking of user generated answers on COVID-19. We specifically explore the utility of external technical sources of side information (such as CDC guidelines or WHO FAQs) in improving answer ranking on such platforms. We found that ranking user answers based on question-answer similarity is not sufficient, and existing models cannot effectively exploit external (side) information. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of different attention based neural models that can directly exploit side information available in technical documents or verified forums (e.g., research publications on COVID-19 or WHO website).

Jussieu, F-75252 Paris Cedex 5, France.		pierre.bras@sorbonne-universite.fr	We study convergence rates of Gibbs measures, with density proportional to, aswhereadmits a unique global minimum at. We focus on the case where the Hessian is not definite at. We assume instead that the minimum is strictly polynomial and give a higher order nested expansion ofat, which depends on every coordinate. We give an algorithm yielding such an expansion if the polynomial order ofis no more than, in connection with Hilbert’sproblem. However, we prove that the case where the order isor higher is fundamentally different and that further assumptions are needed. We then give the rate of convergence of Gibbs measures using this expansion. Finally we adapt our results to the multiple well case.	
[2101.11558] Gain distance matrices for complex unit gain graphs	Aniruddha Samanta M. Rajesh Kannan	Department of Mathematics Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur Kharagpur 721302 India. Email:	rajeshkannan@maths.iitkgp.ac.in aniruddha.sam@gmail.com rajeshkannan1.m@gmail.com	A complex unit gain graph (-gain graph),is a graph where the functionassigns a unit complex number to each orientation of an edge of, and its inverse is assigned to the opposite orientation. In this article, we propose gain distance matrices for-gain graphs. These notions generalize the corresponding known concepts of distance matrices and signed distance matrices. Shahul K. Hameed et al. introduced signed distance matrices and developed their properties. Motivated by their work, we establish several spectral properties, including some equivalences between balanced-gain graphs and gain distance matrices. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of positively weighted-gain graphs and study some of their properties. Using these properties, Acharya’s and Stanić’s spectral criteria for balance are deduced. Moreover, the notions of order independence and distance compatibility are studied. Besides, we obtain some characterizations for distance compatibility.	Keywords.
[2101.11559] A Neighborhood-preserving Graph Summarization	Abd Errahmane KIOUCHE Julien BASTE Mohammed HADDAD Hamida SEBA	Univ Lyon Université Lyon 1 LIRIS UMR CNRS 5205 F-69621 Lyon Ecole nationale Supérieure d’Informatique (ESI) Algeria.	julien.baste@univ-lille.fr	We introduce in this paper a new summarization method for large graphs. Our summarization approach retains only a user-specified proportion of the neighbors of each node in the graph. Our main aim is to simplify large graphs so that they can be analyzed and processed effectively while preserving as many of the node neighborhood properties as possible. Since many graph algorithms are based on the neighborhood information available for each node, the idea is to produce a smaller graph which can be used to allow these algorithms to handle large graphs and run faster while providing good approximations. Moreover, our compression allows users to control the size of the compressed graph by adjusting the amount of information loss that can be tolerated. The experiments conducted on various real and synthetic graphs show that our compression reduces considerably the size of the graphs. Moreover, we conducted several experiments on the obtained summaries using various graph algorithms and applications, such as node embedding, graph classification and shortest path approximations. The obtained results show interesting trade-offs between the algorithms runtime speed-up and the precision loss.

[2101.11562] Scheduled Sampling in Vision-Language Pretraining with Decoupled Encoder-Decoder Network	Yehao Li1, Yingwei Pan1, Ting Yao1, Jingwen Chen2, Tao Mei1			Despite having impressive vision-language (VL) pretraining with BERT-based encoder for VL understanding, the pretraining of a universal encoder-decoder for both VL understanding and generation remains challenging. The difficulty originates from the inherently different peculiarities of the two disciplines, e.g., VL understanding tasks capitalize on the unrestricted message passing across modalities, while generation tasks only employ visual-to-textual message passing. In this paper, we start with a two-stream decoupled design of encoder-decoder structure, in which two decoupled cross-modal encoder and decoder are involved to separately perform each type of proxy tasks, for simultaneous VL understanding and generation pretraining. Moreover, for VL pretraining, the dominant way is to replace some input visual/word tokens with mask tokens and enforce the multi-modal encoder/decoder to reconstruct the original tokens, but no mask token is involved when fine-tuning on downstream tasks. As an alternative, we propose a primary scheduled sampling strategy that elegantly mitigates such discrepancy via pretraining encoder-decoder in a two-pass manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the compelling generalizability of our pretrained encoder-decoder by fine-tuning on four VL understanding and generation downstream tasks.

[2101.11563] Detecting Deepfake Videos Using Euler Video Magnification	Rashmiranjan Das, Gaurav Negiand Alan F. SmeatonSchool of Computing andInsight Centre for Data AnalyticsDublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin, 9, Ireland.Email:		alan.smeaton@dcu.ie	Recent advances in artificial intelligence make it progressively hard to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit media, especially images and videos. One recent development is the rise of deepfake videos, based on manipulating videos using advanced machine learning techniques. This involves replacing the face of an individual from a source video with the face of a second person, in the destination video. This idea is becoming progressively refined as deepfakes are getting progressively seamless and simpler to compute. Combined with the outreach and speed of social media, deepfakes could easily fool individuals when depicting someone saying things that never happened and thus could persuade people in believing fictional scenarios, creating distress, and spreading fake news. In this paper, we examine a technique for possible identification of deepfake videos. We use Euler video magnification which applies spatial decomposition and temporal filtering on video data to highlight and magnify hidden features like skin pulsation and subtle motions. Our approach uses features extracted from the Euler technique to train three models to classify counterfeit and unaltered videos and compare the results with existing techniques.

Torsion is here considered according to the Einstein-Cartan theory with a conformally flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime. In this framework, torsion is seen as an external field, fulfilling precise constraints directly got from the cosmological constant principle. For Dirac field, we find that torsion increases the amount of entanglement. This turns out to be particularly evident for small values of particle momentum. We discuss the roles of Pauli exclusion principle in view of our results, and, in particular, we propose an interpretation of the two maxima that occur for the entanglement entropy in presence of torsion. For Klein-Gordon field, and differently from the Dirac case, the model can be exactly solved by adopting the same scale factor as in the Dirac case. Again, we show how torsion affects the amount of entanglement, providing a robust physical motivation behind the increase or decrease of entanglement entropy. A direct comparison of our findings is also discussed in view of previous results derived in absence of torsion. To this end, we give prominence on how our expectations would change in terms of the coupling between torsion and the scale factor for both Dirac and Klein-Gordon fields.	pacs:98.80.-k | 98.80.Qc | 04.62+v | 03.67.Bg

Recent work predicted that 2d active nematic turbulence follows universal scaling laws. However, experimentally testing these predictions is conditioned by the coupling to the 3d environment. Here, we measure the spectrum of the kinetic energy,, in an active nematic film in contact with a passive oil layer. At small and intermediate scales, we find the scaling regimesand, respectively, in agreement with the theoretical prediction for 2d active nematics. At large scales, however, we find a new scaling, which emerges when the dissipation is dominated by the 3d oil layer. In addition, we derive an explicit expression for the spectrum that spans all length scales, thus explaining and connecting the different scaling regimes. This allows us to fit the data and extract the length scale that controls the crossover to the new large-scale regime, which we tune by varying the oil viscosity. Overall, our work experimentally demonstrates the emergence of universal scaling laws in active turbulence, and it establishes how the spectrum is affected by external dissipation.

I C1428EGA Buenos Aires Royal Institute of Technology 10044 Stockholm of Mathematics Williams College Williamstown MA 01267 	alidick@dm.uba.ar dirocco@kth.se 10rem@williams.edu	We consider systems of Laurent polynomials with support on a fixed point configuration. In the non-defective case, the closure of the locus of coefficients giving a non-degenerate multiple root of the system is defined by a polynomial called themixed discriminant. We define a related polynomial called the multivariateiterated discriminant, generalizing the classical Schäfli method for hyperdeterminants. This iterated discriminant is easier to compute and we prove that it is always divisible by the mixed discriminant. We show that tangent intersections can be computed via iteration if and only if the singular locus of a corresponding dual variety has sufficiently high codimension. We also study when point configurations corresponding to Segre-Veronese varieties and to the lattice points of planar smooth polygons, have their iterated discriminant equal to their mixed discriminant.

We study the impact of coherence in the energy basis in the operation of a small thermal machine which can act either as a heat engine or as a refrigerator. We show that input coherence may enhance the machine performance and allow it to operate in otherwise forbidden regimes. Moreover, our results also indicate that, in some cases, coherence may also be detrimental, rendering optimization of particular models a crucial task for benefiting from coherence-induced enhancements.

Individual privacy-related information is also possibly disclosed unconsciously by the end users. Identifying privacy-related data and protecting the online social network users from privacy leakage turn out to be significant. Under such a motivation, this study aims to propose and develop a hybrid privacy classification approach to detect and classify privacy information from OSNs. The proposed hybrid approach employs both deep learning models and ontology-based models for privacy-related information extraction. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed hybrid approach, and the empirical results demonstrate its superiority in assisting online social network users against privacy leakage.

[2101.11577] Transformer Based Deliberation for Two-Pass Speech Recognition				Interactive speech recognition systems must generate words quickly while also producing accurate results. Two-pass models excel at these requirements by employing a first-pass decoder that quickly emits words, and a second-pass decoder that requires more context but is more accurate. Previous work has established that a deliberation network can be an effective second-pass model. The model attends to two kinds of inputs at once: encoded audio frames and the hypothesis text from the first-pass model. In this work, we explore using transformer layers instead of long-short term memory (LSTM) layers for deliberation rescoring. In transformer layers, we generalize the “encoder-decoder” attention to attend to both encoded audio and first-pass text hypotheses. The output context vectors are then combined by a merger layer. Compared to LSTM-based deliberation, our best transformer deliberation achieves 7% relative word error rate improvements along with a 38% reduction in computation. We also compare against non-deliberation transformer rescoring, and find a 9% relative improvement.

We present a novel photon-mediated cross-resonance gate that is consistent with realistic experimental capabilities and requires no resonant tuning. Furthermore, we propose gate sequences capable of suppressing errors due to quasistatic noise for both the cross-resonance and iSWAP gates.

The search is based on a dataset ofcollisions atrecorded with the ATLAS detector during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb. Events are selected if they have one light lepton (electron or muon) and at least one hadronically decaying-lepton, or at least two light leptons. In addition, two or more jets, at least one of which must be identified as containing-hadrons, are required. Six final states, defined by the multiplicity and flavour of lepton candidates, are considered in the analysis. Each of them is split into multiple event categories to simultaneously search for the signal and constrain several leading backgrounds. The signal-rich event categories require at least one hadronically decaying-lepton candidate and exploit the presence of energetic final-state objects, which is characteristic of signal events. No significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed in any of the considered event categories, and 95% CL upper limits are set on the production cross section as a function of the leptoquark mass, for different assumptions about the branching fractions intoand. Scalar leptoquarks decaying exclusively intoare excluded up to masses ofwhile, for a branching fraction of 50% into, the lower mass limit is.\AtlasRefCodeEXOT-2019-15\PreprintIdNumberCERN-EP-2020-241\AtlasJournalJHEP\AtlasJournalRefJHEP 06 (2021) 179\AtlasDOI10.1007/JHEP06(2021)179	
[2101.11583] Computational strategies and estimation performance with Bayesian semiparametric Item Response Theory models	Sally Paganin Christopher J. Paciorek Claudia Wehrhahn Abel Rodríguez Sophia Rabe-Hesketh Perry de Valpine	of California Berkeley	spaganin@hsph.harvard.edu	Item response theory (IRT) models typically rely on a normality assumption for subject-specific latent traits, which is often unrealistic in practice. Semiparametric extensions based on Dirichlet process mixtures offer a more flexible representation of the unknown distribution of the latent trait. However, the use of such models in the IRT literature has been extremely limited, in good part because of the lack of comprehensive studies and accessible software tools. This paper provides guidance for practitioners on semiparametric IRT models and their implementation. In particular, we rely on NIMBLE, a flexible software system for hierarchical models that enables the use of Dirichlet process mixtures. We highlight efficient sampling strategies for model estimation and compare inferential results under parametric and semiparametric models.	Keywords

In this paper, we prove that for any uniformly contractible manifold with finite asymptotic dimension, its scalar curvature decays to zero at a rate depending only on the contractibility radius of the manifold and the diameter control of the asymptotic dimension. We construct examples of uniformly contractible manifolds with finite asymptotic dimension whose scalar curvature functions decay arbitrarily slowly. This shows that our result is the best possible. We prove our result by studying the index pairing between Dirac operators and compactly supported vector bundles with Lipschitz control. A key technical ingredient for the proof of our main result is a Lipschitz control for the topological-theory of finite dimensional simplicial complexes.	2010 Mathematics Subject Classification:Primary 53C23 | 19D55; Secondary 58B34 | 46L80

We extend this construction to arbitrary countable discrete algebra groups, where superclasses and indecomposable supercharacters play the role of conjugacy classes and indecomposable characters, respectively. Our construction can be understood as a cruder version of Kirillov’s orbit method and a generalisation of Diaconis and Isaacs construction for finite algebra groups. However, we adopt an ergodic theoretical point of view. The theory is then illustrated with the characterisation of the standard supercharacters of the group of upper unitriangular matrices over an algebraic closed field of prime characteristic.

[2101.11588] Differentiable sampling of molecular geometries with uncertainty-based adversarial attacks	Daniel Schwalbe-Koda Aik Rui Tan Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli	thanks:	rafagb@mit.edu	Neural network (NN) interatomic potentials provide fast prediction of potential energy surfaces, closely matching the accuracy of the electronic structure methods used to produce the training data. However, NN predictions are only reliable within well-learned training domains, and show volatile behavior when extrapolating. Uncertainty quantification approaches can flag atomic configurations for which prediction confidence is low, but arriving at such uncertain regions requires expensive sampling of the NN phase space, often using atomistic simulations. Here, we exploit automatic differentiation to drive atomistic systems towards high-likelihood, high-uncertainty configurations without the need for molecular dynamics simulations. By performing adversarial attacks on an uncertainty metric, informative geometries that expand the training domain of NNs are sampled. When combined to an active learning loop, this approach bootstraps and improves NN potentials while decreasing the number of calls to the ground truth method. This efficiency is demonstrated on sampling of kinetic barriers and collective variables in molecules, and can be extended to any NN potential architecture and materials system.

Wrede J. Wulff X. W. Xu Y. Xu J. P. Yanez S. Yoshida T. Yuan and Z. Zhang			Continued improvements on existing reconstruction methods are vital to the success of high-energy physics experiments, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. In IceCube, further challenges arise as the detector is situated at the geographic South Pole where computational resources are limited. However, to perform real-time analyses and to issue alerts to telescopes around the world, powerful and fast reconstruction methods are desired. Deep neural networks can be extremely powerful, and their usage is computationally inexpensive once the networks are trained. These characteristics make a deep learning-based approach an excellent candidate for the application in IceCube. A reconstruction method based on convolutional architectures and hexagonally shaped kernels is presented. The presented method is robust towards systematic uncertainties in the simulation and has been tested on experimental data. In comparison to standard reconstruction methods in IceCube, it can improve upon the reconstruction accuracy, while reducing the time necessary to run the reconstruction by two to three orders of magnitude.	
[2101.11590] Modeling surrender risk in life insurance: theoretical and experimental insight	Mark KiermayerDepartment of Natural ScienceUniversity of Applied Sciences Ruhr		mark.kiermayer@hs-ruhrwest.de	Surrender poses one of the major risks to life insurance and a sound modeling of its true probability has direct implication on the risk capital demanded by the Solvency II directive. We add to the existing literature by performing extensive experiments that present highly practical results for various modeling approaches, including XGBoost, random forest, GLM and neural networks. Further, we detect shortcomings of prevalent model assessments, which are in essence based on a confusion matrix. Our results indicate that accurate label predictions and a sound modeling of the true probability can be opposing objectives. We illustrate this with the example of resampling. While resampling is capable of improving label prediction in rare event settings, such as surrender, and thus is commonly applied, we show theoretically and numerically that models trained on resampled data predict significantly biased event probabilities. Following a probabilistic perspective on surrender, we further propose time-dependent confidence bands on predicted mean surrender rates as a complementary assessment and demonstrate its benefit. This evaluation takes a very practical, going concern perspective, which respects that the composition of a portfolio, as well as the nature of underlying risk drivers might change over time.

We discuss the construction of the equation of state with net baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness using the results of lattice QCD simulations and hadron resonance gas models. Its application to the hydrodynamic analyses of relativistic nuclear collisions suggests that the interplay of multiple conserved charges is important in the quantitative understanding of the dense nuclear matter created at lower beam energies. Several different models of the QCD equation of state are discussed for comparison.	quantum chromodynamics; equation of state; nuclear collision.
[2101.11592] Fast high-fidelity single-qubit gates for flip-flop qubits in silicon	F. A. Calderon-Vargas Edwin Barnes Sophia E. Economou	Present address: Sandia National Laboratories Livermore CA 94550 USA		The flip-flop qubit, encoded in the states with antiparallel donor-bound electron and donor nuclear spins in silicon, showcases long coherence times, good controllability, and, in contrast to other donor-spin-based schemes, long-distance coupling. Electron spin control near the interface, however, is likely to shorten the relaxation time by many orders of magnitude, reducing the overall qubit quality factor. Here, we theoretically study the multilevel system that is formed by the interacting electron and nuclear spins and derive analytical effective two-level Hamiltonians with and without periodic driving. We then propose an optimal control scheme that produces fast and robust single-qubit gates in the presence of low-frequency noise without relying on parametrically restrictive sweet spots. This scheme increases considerably both the relaxation time and the qubit quality factor.

[2101.11594] A tuned mass amplifier for enhanced haptic feedback	Sai Sharan Injeti Ali Israr Tianshu Liu Yiğit Mengüç Daniele Piazza Dongsuk D. Shin	Reality Labs Research Redmond WA USADivision of Engineering and Applied Science California Institute of Technology Pasadena CA USA	ssharaninjeti@gmail.com shindaniel@fb.com	Vibro-tactile feedback is, by far the most common haptic interface in wearable or touchable devices. This feedback can be amplified by controlling the wave propagation characteristics in devices, by utilizing phenomena such as structural resonance. However, much of the work in vibro-tactile haptics has focused on amplifying local displacements in a structure by increasing local compliance. In this paper, we show that engineering the resonance mode shape of a structure with embedded localized mass amplifies the displacements without compromising on the stiffness or resonance frequency. The resulting structure, i.e., atuned mass amplifier, produces higher tactile forces (7.7 times) compared to its counterpart without a mass, while maintaining a low frequency. We optimize the proposed design using a combination of a neural network and sensitivity analysis, and validate the results with experiments on 3-D printed structures. We also study the performance of the device on contact with a soft material, to evaluate the interaction with skin. Potential avenues for future work are also presented, including small form factor wearable haptic devices and remote haptics.Keywords:Vibration, Haptics, Optimal design, Deep learning, 3-D printing	
[2101.11595] Most Powerful Test Sequences with Early Stopping Options	Sergey Tarima Nancy Flournoy	institutetext:		Sequential likelihood ratio testing is found to be most powerful in sequential studies with early stopping rules when grouped data come from the one-parameter exponential family. First, to obtain this elusive result, the probability measure of a group sequential design is constructed with support for all possible outcome events, as is useful for designing an experiment prior to having data. This construction identifies impossible events that are not part of the support. The overall probability distribution is dissected into stage specific components. These components are sub-densities of interim test statistics first described by Armitage, McPherson and Rowe (1969) that are commonly used to create stopping boundaries given an-spending function and a set of interim analysis times. Likelihood expressions conditional on reaching a stage are given to connect pieces of the probability anatomy together.

[2101.11596] Linearly controlled arrangement of ¹³C isotopes in single-wall carbon nanotubes	J. Koltai H. Kuzmany T. Pichler F. Simon	Department of Biological Physics Eötvös University Pázmány Péter sétány 1/A H-1117 Budapest Hungary		The growth of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) inside host SWCNTs remains a compelling alternative to the conventional catalyst induced growth processes. It not only provides a catalyst free process but the ability to control the constituents of the inner tube if appropriate starting molecules are used. We report herein the growth of inner SWCNTs fromC labeled toluene and natural carbon C. The latter molecule is essentially a stopper which acts to retain the smaller toluene. The Raman spectrum of the inner nanotubes is anomalous as it contains a highly isotope shifted ”tail”, which cannot be explained by assuming a homogeneous distribution of the isotopes.Semi-empiricalcalculations of the Raman modes indicate that this unsual effect is explicable if small clusters ofC are assumed. This indicates the absence of carbon diffusion during the inner tube growth. When combined with appropriate molecular recognition, this may enable a molecular engineering of the atomic and isotope composition of the inner tubes.

To solve cuboid manipulation tasks of varying difficulty, we decompose each task into the following primitives: moving the fingers to the cuboid to grasp it, turning it on the table to minimize orientation error, and re-positioning it to the goal position. We use model-based trajectory optimization and control to plan and execute these primitives. These grasping, turning, and re-positioning primitives are sequenced with a state-machine that determines which primitive to execute given the current object state and goal. Our method shows robust performance over multiple runs with randomized initial and goal positions. With this approach, our team placed second in the challenge, under the anonymous name “sombertortoise” on the leaderboard. Example runs of our method solving each of the four levels can be seenin this video.	
[2101.11598] Dissipative state transfer and Maxwell’s demon in single quantum trajectories: Excitation transfer between two noninteracting qubits via unbalanced dissipation rates	Fabrizio Minganti Vincenzo Macrì Alessio Settineri Salvatore Savasta Franco Nori	Quantum Physics Laboratory RIKEN Wako-shi Saitama 351-0198 Japan	fabrizio.minganti@riken.jp vincenzo.macri@riken.jp	We introduce a protocol to transfer excitations between two noninteracting qubits via purely dissipative processes (i.e., in the Lindblad master equation there is no coherent interaction between the qubits). The fundamental ingredients are the presence of collective (i.e. nonlocal) dissipation and unbalanced local dissipation rates (the qubits dissipate at different rates). The resulting quantum trajectories show that the measurement backaction changes the system wave function and induces a passage of the excitation from one qubit to the other. While similar phenomena have been witnessed for a non-Markovian environment, here the dissipative quantum state transfer is induced by an update of the observer knowledge of the wave function in the presence of a Markovian (memoryless) environment—this is a single quantum trajectory effect. Beyond single quantum trajectories and postselection, such an effect can be observed by histogramming the quantum jumps along several realizations at different times. By investigating the effect of the temperature in the presence of unbalanced local dissipation, we demonstrate that, if appropriately switched on and off, the collective dissipator can act as a Maxwell’s demon. These effects are a generalized measure equivalent to the standard projective measure description of quantum teleportation and Maxwell’s demon. They can be witnessed in state-of-the-art setups given the extreme experimental control in, e.g., superconducting qubits or Rydberg atoms.

Classical reconstruction algorithms based on image registration of consecutive slides of stained tissues are prone to errors and often not suitable for the training of three-dimensional segmentation algorithms. We propose a novel framework to generate synthetic three-dimensional histological models based on a generator-discriminator pattern optimizing constrained features that construct a 3D model via a Blender interface exploiting smooth shape continuity typical for biological specimens. To capture the spatial context of entire cell clusters we deploy a novel deep topology transformer that implements and attention mechanism on cell group images to extract features for the frozen feature decoder. The proposed algorithms achieves high quantitative and qualitative synthesis evident in comparative evaluation metrics such as a low Frechet-Inception scores.

The best known lower bound for this problem isby Huang, Ma, Shapira, Sudakov and Yuster. They asked whether this estimate can be improved at least for directed paths instead of cycles and whether one can find a long path starting from any vertex if the host digraph is connected. In this paper we break thebarrier, showing how to find a path of lengthfrom any vertex of a connected Eulerian digraph.

As a passive system which does not produce any light that could interfere with the observations of the fluorescence telescopes of the observatory, it complements the active monitoring systems that use lasers. We discuss the applications of stellar photometry for atmospheric monitoring at optical observatories in general and the particular modes of operation employed by the Auger FRAM. We describe in detail the technical aspects of FRAM, the hardware and software requirements for a successful operation of a robotic telescope for such a purpose and their implementation within the FRAM system.

Under a very general framework we show that there is an interesting relationship between tail asymptotics of sojourn times and that of supremum. Moreover, we establish the uniform double-sum method to derive the tail asymptotics of sojourn times. In the literature, based on the pioneering research of S. Berman the sojourn times have been utilised to derive the tail asymptotics of supremum of Gaussian processes. In this paper we show that the opposite direction is even more fruitful, namely knowing the asymptotics of supremum o f random processes and fields (in particular Gaussian) it is possible to establish the asymptotics of their sojourn times. We illustrate our findings considering i) two dimensional Gaussian random fields, ii) chi-process generated by stationary Gaussian processes and iii) stationary Gaussian queueing processes.

Derpanis&Neil BruceDepartment of Computer Science, Ryerson University, CanadaUniversity of Waterloo, CanadaIWR, HCI, Heidelberg University, GermanySchool of Computer Science, University of Guelph, CanadaSamsung AI Centre Toronto, CanadaVector Institute for AI,		brucen@uoguelph.ca sen.jia@uwaterloo.ca	Contrasting the previous evidence that neurons in the later layers of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) respond to complex object shapes, recent studies have shown that CNNs actually exhibit a ‘texture bias’: given an image with both texture and shape cues (e.g., a stylized image), a CNN is biased towards predicting the category corresponding to the texture. However, these previous studies conduct experiments on thefinal classification outputof the network, and fail to robustly evaluate the bias contained (i) in the latent representations, and (ii) on a per-pixel level. In this paper, we design a series of experiments that overcome these issues. We do this with the goal of better understanding what type of shape information contained in the network is discriminative, where shape information is encoded, as well as when the network learns about object shape during training. We show that a network learns the majority of overall shape information at the first few epochs of training and that this information is largely encoded in the last few layers of a CNN. Finally, we show that the encoding of shape does not imply the encoding of localized per-pixel semantic information. The experimental results and findings provide a more accurate understanding of the behaviour of current CNNs, thus helping to inform future design choices.	
[2101.11605] Bottleneck Transformers for Visual Recognition	Aravind SrinivasTsung-Yi LinNiki ParmarJonathon ShlensPieter AbbeelAshish VaswaniUC BerkeleyGoogle			We present BoTNet, a conceptually simple yet powerful backbone architecture that incorporates self-attention for multiple computer vision tasks including image classification, object detection and instance segmentation. By just replacing the spatial convolutions with global self-attention in the final three bottleneck blocks of a ResNet and no other changes, our approach improves upon the baselines significantly on instance segmentation and object detection while also reducing the parameters, with minimal overhead in latency. Through the design of BoTNet, we also point out how ResNet bottleneck blocks with self-attention can be viewed as Transformer blocks. Without any bells and whistles, BoTNet achieves44.4% Mask AP and49.7% Box AP on the COCO Instance Segmentation benchmark using the Mask R-CNN framework; surpassing the previous best published single model and single scale results of ResNeSt[67]evaluated on the COCO validation set. Finally, we present a simple adaptation of the BoTNet design for image classification, resulting in models that achieve a strong performance of84.7% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark while being up to1.64xfaster in “compute”111Forward and backward propagation for batch size 32time than the popular EfficientNet models on TPU-v3 hardware. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a strong baseline for future research in self-attention models for vision.

The test samples can additionally contain seen categories in the generalized variant. Existing approaches rely on learning either shared or label-specific attention from the seen classes. Nevertheless, computing reliable attention maps for unseen classes during inference in a multi-label setting is still a challenge. In contrast, state-of-the-art single-label generative adversarial network (GAN) based approaches learn to directly synthesize the class-specific visual features from the corresponding class attribute embeddings. However, synthesizing multi-label features from GANs is still unexplored in the context of zero-shot setting. In this work, we introduce different fusion approaches at the attribute-level, feature-level and cross-level (across attribute and feature-levels) for synthesizing multi-label features from their corresponding multi-label class embeddings. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to tackle the problem of multi-label feature synthesis in the (generalized) zero-shot setting. Comprehensive experiments are performed on three zero-shot image classification benchmarks: NUS-WIDE, Open Images and MS COCO. Our cross-level fusion-based generative approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on all three datasets. Furthermore, we show the generalization capabilities of our fusion approach in the zero-shot detection task on MS COCO, achieving favorable performance against existing methods.

Mazziotti	of Chemistry and The James Franck Institute The University of Chicago Chicago IL 60637	damazz@uchicago.edu	Molecular simulations generally require fermionic encoding in which fermion statistics are encoded into the qubit representation of the wave function. Recent calculations suggest that fermionic encoding of the wave function can be bypassed, leading to more efficient quantum computations. Here we show that the energy can be expressed as a functional of the two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) where the 2-RDM is a unique functional of the unencoded-qubit-particle wave function. Contrasts are made with current hardware-efficient methods. An application to computing the ground-state energy and 2-RDM of His presented.	
[2101.11608] Reduced Order and Surrogate Models for Gravitational Waves	Manuel Tiglio111email:  Aarón Villanueva222email:		mtiglio@unc.edu.ar aaron.villanueva@unc.edu.ar	We present an introduction to some of the state of the art in reduced order and surrogate modeling in gravitational wave (GW) science. Approaches that we cover include Principal Component Analysis, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, the Reduced Basis approach, the Empirical Interpolation Method, Reduced Order Quadratures, and Compressed Likelihood evaluations. We divide the review into three parts: representation/compression of known data, predictive models, and data analysis. The targeted audience is that one of practitioners in GW science, a field in which building predictive models and data analysis tools that are both accurate and fast to evaluate, especially when dealing with large amounts of data and intensive computations, are necessary yet can be challenging. As such, practical presentations and, sometimes, heuristic approaches are here preferred over rigor when the latter is not available. This review aims to be self-contained, within reasonable page limits, with little previous knowledge (at the undergraduate level) requirements in mathematics, scientific computing, and other disciplines. Emphasis is placed on optimality, as well as the curse of dimensionality and approaches that might have the promise of beating it. We also review most of the state of the art of GW surrogates. Some numerical algorithms, conditioning details, scalability, parallelization and other practical points are discussed. The approaches presented are to large extent non-intrusive and data-driven and can therefore be applicable to other disciplines. We close with open challenges in high dimension surrogates, which are not unique to GW science.	
[2101.11609] Stability against contact interactions of a topological superconductor in two-dimensional space protected by time-reversal and reflection symmetries	Ömer M. Aksoy Jyong-Hao Chen Shinsei Ryu Akira Furusaki Christopher Mudry	Condensed Matter Theory Group Paul Scherrer Institute CH-5232 Villigen PSI Switzerland		We study the stability of topological crystalline superconductors in the symmetry class DIIIR and in two-dimensional space when perturbed by quartic contact interactions. It is known that no less than eight copies of helical pairs of Majorana edge modes can be gapped out by an appropriate interaction without spontaneously breaking any one of the protecting symmetries. Hence, the noninteracting classificationreduces towhen these interactions are present. It is also known that the stability when there are less than eight modes can be understood in terms of the presence of topological obstructions in the low-energy bosonic effective theories, which prevent opening of a gap. Here, we investigate the stability of the edge theories with four, two, and one edge modes, respectively. We give an analytical derivation of the topological term for the first case, because of which the edge theory remains gapless. For two edge modes, we employ bosonization methods to derive an effective bosonic action. When gapped, this bosonic theory is necessarily associated to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of either one of time-reversal or reflection symmetry whenever translation symmetry remains on the boundary. For one edge mode, stability is explicitly established in the Majorana representation of the edge theory.

By means of quantum Monte Carlo at finite temperature and ground state density matrix renormalization group simulations, we map out the phase diagram of triangular quantum Ising model. Starting from the upper BKT temperature at zero field, we obtain the phase boundary between the UUD and paramagnetic phases with its 2DPotts universality at weak field and weakly first order transition at strong field. Originated from the lower BKT temperature at zero field, we analyze the low temperature phase boundary between the clock phase and the UUD phase with Ising symmetry breaking at weak fields and the quantum phase transition between the UUD and fully polarized phases at strong fields. The accurate many-body numerical results are consistent with our field theoretical analysis. The experimental relevance towards the BKT magnet TmMgGaOand programmable quantum simulators are also discussed.

Cederbaum	of Mathematics University of Haifa Haifa 3498838 IsraelHaifa Research Center for Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics University of Haifa Haifa 3498838 Israel	ofir@research.haifa.ac.il raphael.beinke@pci.uni-heidelberg.de lorenz.cederbaum@pci.uni-heidelberg.de	This review explores the dynamics and the low-energy excitation spectra of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of interacting bosons in external potential traps putting particular emphasis on the emerging many-body effects beyond mean-field descriptions. To do so, methods have to be used that, in principle, can provide numerically exact results for both the dynamics and the excitation spectra in a systematic manner. Numerically exact results for the dynamics are presented employing the well-established multicongurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons (MCTDHB) method. The respective excitation spectra are calculated utilizing the more recently introduced linear-response theory atop it (LR-MCTDHB). The latter theory gives rise to an, in general, non-hermitian eigenvalue problem. The theory and its newly developed implementation are described in detail and benchmarked towards the exactly-solvable harmonic-interaction model. Several applications to BECs in one- and two-dimensional potential traps are discussed. With respect to dynamics, it is shown that both the out-of-equilibrium tunneling dynamics and the dynamics of trapped vortices are of many-body nature. Furthermore, many-body effects in the excitation spectra are presented for BECs in different trap geometries. It is demonstrated that even for essentially-condensed systems, the spectrum of the lowest-in-energy excitations computed at the many-body level can differ substantially from the standard mean-field description. In general, it is shown that bosons carrying angular momentum are more sensitive to many-body effects than bosons without. These effects are present in both the dynamics and the excitation spectrum.

For millimeter waves or THz waves, techniques from both fields can be merged to identify materials at the micron scale on the surface or in near-surface volumes. The principle of such near-field vector imaging at the frequency of 60 GHz is discussed in detail here. We develop techniques for extracting vector voltages and methods for extracting the normalized near-field vector reflection on the sample. In particular, the subharmonic IQ mixer imbalance, which produced corrupted outputs either due to amplitude or phase differences, must be taken into account and compensated for to avoid any systematic errors. We provide a method to fully characterize these imperfections and to isolate the only contribution of the near-field interaction between the probe and the sample. The effects of the mechanical modulation waveform and harmonic rank used for signal acquisition are also discussed.

[2101.11617] Dimensional Reduction and (Anti) de Sitter Bounds		footnotemark:		Dimensional reduction has proven to be a surprisingly powerful tool for delineating the boundary between the string landscape and the swampland. Bounds from the Weak Gravity Conjecture and the Repulsive Force Conjecture, for instance, are exactly preserved under dimensional reduction. Motivated by its success in these cases, we apply a similar dimensional reduction analysis to bounds on the gradient of the scalar field potentialand the mass scaleof a tower of light particles in terms of the cosmological constant, which ideally may pin down ambiguousconstants appearing in the de Sitter Conjecture and the (Anti) de Sitter Distance Conjecture, respectively. We find that this analysis distinguishes the bounds,, andin-dimensional Planck units. The first of these bounds precludes accelerated expansion of the universe in Einstein-dilaton gravity and is almost certainly violated in our universe, though it may apply in asymptotic limits of scalar field space. The second bound cannot be satisfied in our universe, though it is saturated in supersymmetric AdS vacua with well-understood uplifts to 10d/11d supergravity. The third bound likely has a limited range of validity in quantum gravity as well, so it may or may not apply to our universe. However, if it does apply, it suggests a possible relation between the cosmological constant and the neutrino mass, which (by the see-saw mechanism) may further provide a relation between the cosmological constant problem and the hierarchy problem. We also work out the conditions for eternal inflation in general spacetime dimensions, and we comment on the behavior of these conditions under dimensional reduction.	
[2101.11618] The RR Lyrae Delay-Time Distribution: A Novel Perspective on Models of Old Stellar Populations	Sumit K. Sarbadhicary Mairead Heiger Carles Badenes Cecilia Mateu Jeffrey Newman Robin Ciardullo Na’ama Hallakoun Dan Maoz Laura Chomiuk	Department of Physics and Astronomy Michigan State University East Lansing MI 48824 USA		The delay-time distribution (DTD) is the occurrence rate of a class of objects as a function of time after a hypothetical burst of star formation. DTDs are mainly used as a statistical test of stellar evolution scenarios for supernova progenitors, but they can be applied to many other classes of astronomical objects. We calculate the first DTD for RR Lyrae variables using 29,810 RR Lyrae from the OGLE-IV survey and a map of the stellar-age distribution (SAD) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find thatof the OGLE-IV RR Lyrae are associated with delay-times older than 8 Gyr (main-sequence progenitor masses less than 1 M), and consistent with existing constraints on their ages, but surprisingly aboutof RR Lyrae appear have delay timesGyr (main-sequence masses betweenMat LMC metallicity). This intermediate-age signal also persists outside the Bar-region where crowding is less of a concern, and we verified that without this signal, the spatial distribution of the OGLE-IV RR Lyrae is inconsistent with the SAD map of the LMC. Since an intermediate-age RR Lyrae channel is in tension with the lack of RR Lyrae in intermediate-age clusters (noting issues with small-number statistics), and the age-metallicity constraints of LMC stars, our DTD result possibly indicates that systematic uncertainties may still exist in SAD measurements of old-stellar populations, perhaps stemming from the construction methodology or the stellar evolution models used. We described tests to further investigate this issue.

[2101.11621] Superheavy scalar dark matter from gravitational particle production in 𝛼-attractor models of inflation	Siyang Ling and Andrew J. Long			We study the phenomenon of gravitational particle production as applied to a scalar spectator field in the context of-attractor inflation. Assuming that the scalar has a minimal coupling to gravity, we calculate the abundance of gravitationally-produced particles as a function of the spectator’s massand the inflaton’sparameter. If the spectator is stable and sufficiently weakly coupled, such that it does not thermalize after reheating, then a population of spin-0 particles is predicted to survive in the universe today, providing a candidate for dark matter. Inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of dark matter correspond to an isocurvature component, which can be probed by measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies. We calculate the dark matter-photon isocurvature power spectrum and by comparing with upper limits fromPlanck, we infer constraints onand. If the scalar spectator makes up all of the dark matter today, then forandwe obtain, whereis the inflaton’s mass.	
[2101.11622] No velocity-kicks are required to explain large-distance offsets of Ca-rich supernovae and short-GRBs	Hagai B. Peretsand Paz BeniaminiPhysics Department, Technion — Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 3200003, IsraelTheoretical Astrophysics, Walter Burke Institute for Theoretical Physics, Mail Code 350-17, Caltech, Pasadena, CA 91125, USAAstrophysics Research Center of the Open University , The Open University of Israel, P.O Box 808, Ra’anana 43537, Israel	pagerange:		The environments of explosive transients link their progenitors to the underlying stellar population, providing critical clues for their origins. However, some Ca-rich supernovae (SNe) and short gamma ray burst (sGRBs) appear to be located at remote locations, far from the stellar population of their host galaxy, challenging our understanding of their origin and/or physical evolution. These findings instigated models suggesting that either large velocity kicks were imparted to their progenitors, allowing them to propagate to large distances and attain their remote locations; or that they formed in dense globular clusters residing in the halos. Here we show that instead, the large spatial-offsets of these transients are naturally explained by the observations of highly extended underlying stellar populations in (mostly early type) galaxy halos, typically missed since they can only be identified through ultra-deep/stacked images. Consequently,no large velocity kicks, nor halo globular cluster environments are required in order to explain the origin of these transients. These findings support thermonuclear explosions on white-dwarfs, for the origins of Ca-rich SNe progenitors, and no/small-natal-kicks given to sGRB progenitors. Since early-type galaxies contain older stellar populations, transient arising from older stellar populations would have larger fractions of early-type galaxy hosts, and consequently larger fractions of transients at large offsets. This is verified by our results for sGRBs and Ca-rich SNe showing different offset distributions in early vs. late-type galaxies. Furthermore, once divided between early and late type galaxies, the offsets’ distributions of the different transients are consistent with each other. Finally, we point out that studies of other transients’ offset distribution (e.g. Ia-SNe or FRBs) should similarly consider the host galaxy-type.	stars: neutron stars – (stars:) gamma-ray burst: general – transients: supernova– transients:) neutron star mergers – (transients:) gamma-ray bursts – (transients:) fast radio bursts
[2101.11623] Causality in gravitational theories with second order equations of motion	Harvey S. ReallDepartment of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of CambridgeWilberforce Road, Cambridge CB3 0WA, United		hsr1000@cam.ac.uk	This paper considers diffeomorphism invariant theories of gravity coupled to matter, with second order equations of motion. This includes Einstein-Maxwell and Einstein-scalar field theory with (after field redefinitions) the most general parity-symmetric four-derivative effective field theory corrections. A gauge-invariant approach is used to study the characteristics associated to the physical degrees of freedom in an arbitrary background solution. The symmetries of the principal symbol arising from diffeomorphism invariance and the action principle are determined. For gravity coupled to a single scalar field (i.e. a Horndeski theory) it is shown that causality is governed by a characteristic polynomial of degreewhich factorises into a product of quadratic and quartic polynomials. The former is defined in terms of an “effective metric” and is associated with a “purely gravitational” polarisation, whereas the latter generically involves a mixture of gravitational and scalar field polarisations. The “fastest” degrees of freedom are associated with the quartic polynomial, which defines a surface analogous to the Fresnel surface in crystal optics. In contrast with optics, this surface is generically non-singular except on certain surfaces in spacetime. It is shown that a Killing horizon is an example of such a surface. It is also shown that a Killing horizon satisfies the zeroth law of black hole mechanics. The characteristic polynomial defines a cone in the cotangent space and a dual cone in the tangent space. The latter is used to define basic notions of causality and to provide a definition of a dynamical black hole in these theories.

The simulations are among the first to employ multi-frequency, on-the-fly radiation transfer and constrained transport ideal MHD in a cosmological context to simultaneously model the inhomogeneous process of reionization as well as the growth of primordial magnetic fields. We run a series ofcosmological volumes, varying both the strength of the seed magnetic field and its spectral index. We find that PMFs with a spectral index () and a comoving amplitude () that haveproduce electron optical depths () that are inconsistent with CMB constraints due to the unrealistically early collapse of low-mass dwarf galaxies. For, our constraints are considerably tighter than theconstraints from Planck. PMFs that do not satisfy our constraints have little impact on the reionization history or the shape of the UV luminosity function. Likewise, detecting changes in the Lyforest due to PMFs will be challenging because photoionisation and photoheating efficiently smooth the density field. However, we find that the first absorption feature in the global 21cm signal is a particularly sensitive indicator of the properties of the PMFs, even for those that satisfy ourconstraint. Furthermore, strong PMFs can marginally increase the escape of LyC photons by up to 25% and shrink the effective radii of galaxies bywhich could increase the completeness fraction of galaxy surveys. Finally, our simulations show that surveys with a magnitude limit ofcan probe the sources that provide the majority of photons for reionization out to.	galaxies: high-redshift | (cosmology:) dark ages | reionization | first stars | galaxies: ISM | (ISM:) HII regions | galaxies: star formation
[2101.11625] Extended X-ray Emission in Compton Thick AGN with Deep Chandra Observations	Mackenzie L. Jones Kieran Parker G. Fabbiano Martin Elvis W. P. Maksym A. Paggi Jingzhe Ma M. Karovska A. Siemiginowska Junfeng Wang	Center for Astrophysics — Harvard & Smithsonian 80 Garden St Cambridge MA 02138 USA		We present the spatial analysis of five Compton thick (CT) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including MKN 573, NGC 1386, NGC 3393, NGC 5643, and NGC 7212, for which high resolutionChandraobservations are available. For each source, we find hard X-ray emission (3 keV) extending tokpc scales along the ionization cone, and for some sources, in the cross-cone region. This collection represents the first, high-signal sample of CT AGN with extended hard X-ray emission for which we can begin to build a more complete picture of this new population of AGN. We investigate the energy dependence of the extended X-ray emission, including possible dependencies on host galaxy and AGN properties, and find a correlation between the excess emission and obscuration, suggesting a connection between the nuclear obscuring material and the galactic molecular clouds. Furthermore, we find that the soft X-ray emission extends farther than the hard X-rays along the ionization cone, which may be explained by a galactocentric radial dependence on the density of molecular clouds due to the orientation of the ionization cone with respect to the galactic disk. These results are consistent with other CT AGN with observed extended hard X-ray emission (e.g., ESO 428-G014 and theMa et al.2020CT AGN sample), further demonstrating the ubiquity of extended hard X-ray emission in CT AGN.	galaxies: active; X-rays: galaxies

[2101.11627] Recovering Density Fields inside Quasar Proximity Zones at 𝑧∼6	Huanqing Chen Nickolay Y. Gnedin	Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics; The University of Chicago; Chicago IL 60637 USA	hqchen@uchicago.edu	The matter density field atis very challenging to probe. One of the traditional probes of the low density IGM that works successfully at lower redshifts is the Lyman-alpha forest in quasar spectra. However, at the end of reionization, the residual neutral hydrogen usually creates saturated absorption, thus much of the information about the gas density is lost. Luckily, in a quasar proximity zone, the ionizing radiation is exceptionally intense, thus creating a large region with non-zero transmitted flux. In this study we use the synthetic spectra from simulations to investigate how to recover the density fluctuations inside the quasar proximity zones. We show that, under ideal conditions, the density can be recovered accurately with a small scatter. We also discuss how systematics such as the quasar continuum fitting and reionization models affect the results. This study shows that by analyzing the absorption features inside quasar proximity zones we can potentially constrain quasar properties and the environments they reside in.

In any concrete scenario, reference frames are associated to physical systems, which are ultimately quantum in nature. A relativistic description of the laws of physics hence needs to take into account such quantum reference frames (QRFs), through which spacetime can be given an operational meaning.

[2101.11630] Simple and maximally robust processes with no classical common-cause or direct-cause explanation	Marcello Nery Marco Túlio Quintino Philippe Allard Guérin Thiago O. Maciel Reinaldo O. Vianna	de Física Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais Av. Pres. Antonio Carlos 6627 - Belo Horizonte MG Brazil - 31270-901.	mnerygvb@gmail.com	Guided by the intuition of coherent superposition of causal relations, recent works presented quantum processes without classical common-cause and direct-cause explanation, that is, processes which cannot be written as probabilistic mixtures of quantum common-cause and quantum direct-cause relations (CCDC). In this work, we analyze the minimum requirements for a quantum process to fail to admit a CCDC explanation and present “simple” processes, which we prove to be the most robust ones against general noise. These simple processes can be realized by preparing a maximally entangled state and applying the identity quantum channel, thus not requiring an explicit coherent mixture of common-cause and direct-cause, exploiting the possibility of a process to have both relations simultaneously. We then prove that, although all bipartite direct-cause processes are bipartite separable operators, there exist bipartite separable processes which are not direct-cause. This shows that the problem of deciding whether a process is direct-causeis notequivalent to entanglement certification and points out the limitations of entanglement methods to detect non-classical CCDC processes. We also present a semi-definite programming hierarchy that can detect and quantify the non-classical CCDC robustnesses of every non-classical CCDC process. Among other results, our numerical methods allow us to show that the simple processes presented here are likely to be also the maximally robust against white noise. Finally, we explore the equivalence between bipartite direct-cause processes and bipartite processes without quantum memory, to present a separable process which cannot be realized as a process without quantum memory.	
[2101.11631] Impact of correlations and heavy-tails on quantum error correction	B.D. Clader Colin J. Trout Jeff P. Barnes Kevin Schultz Gregory Quiroz Paraj Titum		dave.clader@jhuapl.edu	We show that space- and time-correlated single-qubit rotation errors can lead to high-weight errors in a quantum circuit when the rotation angles are drawn from heavy-tailed distributions. This leads to a breakdown ofquantum error correction, yielding reduced or in some cases no protection of the encoded logical qubits. While heavy-tailed phenomena are prevalent in the natural world, there is very little research as to whether noise with these statistics exist in current quantum processing devices. Furthermore, it is an open problem to develop tomographic or noise spectroscopy protocols that could test for the existence of noise with such statistics. These results suggest the need for quantum characterization methods that can reliably detect or reject the presence of such errors together with continued first-principles studies of the origins of space- and time-correlated noise in quantum processors. If such noise does exist, physical or control-based mitigation protocols must be developed to mitigate this noise as it would severely hinder the performance of fault-tolerant quantum computers.	
[2101.11632] Towards studying the structural differences between the pion and its radial excitation	Xiang Gao Nikhil Karthik Swagato Mukherjee Peter Petreczky Sergey Syritsyn Yong Zhao	Department Brookhaven National Laboratory Upton NY 11973 USAPhysics Department Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 China	nkarthik.work@gmail.com xgao@bnl.gov	We present an exploratory lattice QCD investigation of the differences between the valence quark structure of pion and its radial excitationin a fixed finite volume using the leading-twist factorization approach. We present evidences that the first pion excitation in our lattice computation is a single particle state that is likely to be the finite volume realization of. An analysis with reasonable priors result in better estimates of the excited state PDF and the moments, wherein we find evidence that the radial excitation of pion correlates with an almost two-fold increase in the momentum fraction of valence quarks. This proof-of-principle work establishes the viability of future lattice computations incorporating larger operator basis that can resolve the structural changes accompanying hadronic excitation.	
[2101.11633] Statistical physics through the lens of real-space mutual information	Doruk Efe Gökmen Zohar Ringel Sebastian D. Huber Maciej Koch-Janusz	Institute for Theoretical Physics ETH Zurich 8093 Zurich Switzerland		Identifying the relevant degrees of freedom in a complex physical system is a key stage in developing effective theories in and out of equilibrium. The celebrated renormalization group provides a framework for this, but its practical execution in unfamiliar systems is fraught with ad hoc choices, whereas machine learning approaches, though promising, lack formal interpretability. Here we present an algorithm employing state-of-art results in machine-learning-based estimation of information-theoretic quantities, overcoming these challenges, and use this advance to develop a new paradigm in identifying the most relevant operators describing properties of the system. We demonstrate this on an interacting model, where the emergent degrees of freedom are qualitatively different from the microscopic constituents. Our results push the boundary of formally interpretable applications of machine learning, conceptually paving the way towards automated theory building.	
[2101.11634] Unlocking starlight subtraction in full data rate exoplanet imaging by efficiently updating Karhunen-Loève eigenimages	Joseph D. Long Jared R. Males	Steward Observatory The University of Arizona Tucson Arizona USA		Starlight subtraction algorithms based on the method of Karhunen-Loève eigenimages have proved invaluable to exoplanet direct imaging. However, they scale poorly in runtime when paired with differential imaging techniques. In such observations, reference frames and frames to be starlight-subtracted are drawn from the same set of data, requiring a new subset of references (and eigenimages) for each frame processed to avoid self-subtraction of the signal of interest. The data rates of extreme adaptive optics instruments are such that the only way to make this computationally feasible has been to downsample the data. We develop a technique that updates a pre-computed singular value decomposition of the full dataset to remove frames (i.e. a “downdate”) without a full recomputation, yielding the modified eigenimages. This not only enables analysis of much larger data volumes in the same amount of time, but also exhibits near-linear scaling in runtime as the number of observations increases. We apply this technique to archival data and investigate its scaling behavior for very large numbers of frames. The resulting algorithm provides speed improvements of(for 200 eigenimages at) to(at) with the advantage only increasing asgrows. This algorithm has allowed us to substantially accelerate KLIP even for modest, and will let us quickly explore how KLIP parameters affect exoplanet characterization in largedatasets.

Gendreau Zaven Arzoumanian Deepto Chakrabarty	Istanbul University Science Faculty Department of Astronomy and Space Sciences Beyazıt 34119 İstanbul TurkeyIstanbul University Observatory Research and Application Center Istanbul University 34119 İstanbul Turkey		We report the temporal and spectral analysis of three thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 4U 160852, observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) during and just after the outburst observed from the source in 2020. In two of the X-ray bursts, we detect secondary peaks, 30 and 18 seconds after the initial peaks. The secondary peaks show a fast rise exponential decay-like shape resembling a thermonuclear X-ray burst. Time-resolved X-ray spectral analysis reveals that the peak flux, blackbody temperature, and apparent emitting radius values of the initial peaks are in agreement with X-ray bursts previously observed from 4U 160852, while the same values for the secondary peaks tend toward the lower end of the distribution of bursts observed from this source. The third X-ray burst, which happened during much lower accretion rates did not show any evidence for a deviation from an exponential decay and was significantly brighter than the previous bursts. We present the properties of the secondary peaks and discuss the events within the framework of short recurrence time bursts or bursts with secondary peaks. We find that the current observations do not fit in standard scenarios and challenge our understanding of flame spreading.

For a small fraction of these sources, the astrometric solutions are poor, and the reported values and uncertainties may not apply. Before any analysis, it is important to recognize and excise these spurious results – this is commonly done by means of quality flags in the Gaia catalog. Here, we devise a means of separating “good” from “bad” astrometric solutions that is an order of magnitude cleaner than any single flag: 99.3% pure and 97.3% complete, as validated on our test data. We devise an extensive sample of manifestly bad astrometric solutions, with parallax that isnegativeat; and a corresponding sample of presumably good solutions, including sources in HEALPix pixels on the sky that do not contain such negative parallaxes, and sources that fall on the main sequence in a color–absolute magnitude diagram. We then train a neural network that uses 17 pertinent Gaia catalog entries and information about nearby sources to discriminate between these two samples, captured in a single “astrometric fidelity” parameter. A diverse set of verification tests shows that our approach works very cleanly, including for sources with positive parallaxes. The main limitations of our approach are in the very low-SNR and the crowded regime. Our astrometric fidelities for all of eDR3 can be queried via the Virtual Observatory, our code and data are public.

[2101.11642] Monodromy methods for torus conformal blocks and entanglement entropy at large central charge	Marius Gerbershagen	institutetext:	marius.gerbershagen@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de	We compute the entanglement entropy in a two dimensional conformal field theory at finite size and finite temperature in the large central charge limit via the replica trick. We first generalize the known monodromy method for the calculation of conformal blocks on the plane to the torus. Then, we derive a monodromy method for the zero-point conformal blocks of the replica partition function. We explain the differences between the two monodromy methods before applying them to the calculation of the entanglement entropy. We find that the contribution of the vacuum exchange dominates the entanglement entropy for a large class of CFTs, leading to universal results in agreement with holographic predictions from the RT formula. Moreover, we determine in which regime the replica partition function agrees with a correlation function of local twist operators on the torus.

Pengfei Li Federico Lelli Stacy McGaugh James Schombert Kyu-Hyun Chae	institutetext:	PengfeiLi0606@gmail.com	The application of Bayesian techniques to astronomical data is generally non-trivial because the fitting parameters can be strongly degenerated and the formal uncertainties are themselves uncertain. An example is provided by the contradictory claims over the presence or absence of a universal acceleration scale (g) in galaxies based on Bayesian fits to rotation curves. To illustrate the situation, we present an analysis in which the Newtonian gravitational constantis allowed to vary from galaxy to galaxy when fitting rotation curves from the SPARC database, in analogy toin the recently debated Bayesian analyses. When imposing flat priors on, we obtain a wide distribution ofwhich, taken at face value, would rule outas a universal constant with high statistical confidence. However, imposing an empirically motivated log-normal prior returns a virtually constantwith no sacrifice in fit quality. This implies that the inference of a variable(or g) is the result of the combined effect of parameter degeneracies and unavoidable uncertainties in the error model. When these effects are taken into account, the SPARC data are consistent with a constant(and constant).

[2101.11645] AGN-driven galactic outflows: comparing models to observations	W. Ishibashi, A. C. Fabianand N. Arakawa00footnotemark:000footnotemark:0Physik-Institut, Universitat Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, 8057 Zurich, SwitzerlandInstitute of Astronomy, Madingley Road, Cambridge CB3 0HA	footnotemark:	wako.ishibashi@physik.uzh.ch	The actual mechanism(s) powering galactic outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still a matter of debate. At least two physical models have been considered in the literature: wind shocks and radiation pressure on dust. Here we provide a first quantitative comparison of the AGN radiative feedback scenario with observations of galactic outflows. We directly compare our radiation pressure-driven shell models with the observational data from the most recent compilation of molecular outflows on galactic scales. We show that the observed dynamics and energetics of galactic outflows can be reproduced by AGN radiative feedback, with the inclusion of radiation trapping and/or luminosity evolution. The predicted scalings of the outflow energetics with AGN luminosity can also quantitatively account for the observational scaling relations. Furthermore, sources with both ultra-fast and molecular outflow detections are found to be located in the ‘forbidden’ region of theplane. Overall, an encouraging agreement is obtained over a wide range of AGN and host galaxy parameters. We discuss our results in the context of recent observational findings and numerical simulations. In conclusion, AGN radiative feedback is a promising mechanism for driving galactic outflows that should be considered, alongside wind feedback, in the interpretation of future observational data.	black hole physics - galaxies: active - galaxies: evolution
[2101.11646] Green function estimates on complements of low-dimensional uniformly rectifiable sets	Guy David Joseph Feneuil Svitlana Mayboroda	Guy David. Université Paris-Saclay CNRS Laboratoire de mathématiques d’Orsay 91405 Orsay 	joseph.feneuil@gmail.com guy.david@universite-paris-saclay.fr svitlana@math.umn.edu	It has been recently established in[DM2]that on uniformly rectifiable sets the Green function is almost affine in the weak sense, and moreover, in some scenarios such Green function estimates are equivalent to the uniform rectifiability of a set. The present paper tackles a strong analogue of these results, starting with the “flagship” degenerate operators on sets with lower dimensional boundaries.	Key words/Mots clés.

To overcome the lack of wireless resources, we propose a machine learning-based solution, where only a fraction of actuators is controlled, while the rest of the actuators are actuated by locally predicting the missing state and/or action information using the previous uplink and/or downlink receptions via a Gaussian process regression (GPR). This GPR prediction credibility is determined using the age-of-information (AoI) of the latest reception. Moreover, the successful reception is affected by the transmission power, mandating a co-design of the communication and control operations. To this end, we formulate a network-wide minimization problem of the average AoI and transmission power under communication reliability and control stability constraints. To solve the problem, we propose a dynamic control algorithm using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization framework. Numerical results corroborate that the proposed algorithm can stably controlx more number of actuators compared to an event-triggered scheduling baseline with Kalman filtering and frequency division multiple access, which isx larger than a round-robin scheduling baseline.

[2101.11648] Island Finder and Entropy Bound	Raphael Bousso and Arvin Shahbazi-Moghaddam	institutetext:	bousso@berkeley.edu arvinshm@gmail.com	Identifying an entanglement island requires exquisite control over the entropy of quantum fields, which is available only in toy models. Here we present a set of sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of an island and place an upper bound on the entropy computed by the island rule. This is enough to derive the main features of the Page curve for an evaporating black hole in any spacetime dimension. Our argument makes use of Wall’s maximin formulation and the Quantum Focusing Conjecture. As a corollary, we derive a novel entropy bound.	
[2101.11649] Multigrid reduction preconditioning framework for coupled processes in porous and fractured media	Quan M. Bui François P. Hamon Nicola Castelletto Daniel Osei-Kuffuor Randolph R. Settgast Joshua A. White		bui9@llnl.gov white230@llnl.gov settgast1@llnl.gov castelletto1@llnl.gov oseikuffuor1@llnl.gov francois.hamon@total.com	Many subsurface engineering applications involve tight-coupling between fluid flow, solid deformation, fracturing, and similar processes. To better understand the complex interplay of different governing equations, and therefore design efficient and safe operations, numerical simulations are widely used. Given the relatively long time-scales of interest, fully-implicit time-stepping schemes are often necessary to avoid time-step stability restrictions. A major computational bottleneck for these methods, however, is the linear solver. These systems are extremely large and ill-conditioned. Because of the wide range of processes and couplings that may be involved—e.g. formation and propagation of fractures, deformation of the solid porous medium, viscous flow of one or more fluids in the pores and fractures, complicated well sources and sinks, etc.—it is difficult to develop general-purpose but scalable linear solver frameworks. This challenge is further aggravated by the range of different discretization schemes that may be adopted, which have a direct impact on the linear system structure. To address this obstacle, we describe a flexiblestrategybased on multigrid reduction (MGR) that can produce purely algebraic preconditioners for a wide spectrum of relevant physics and discretizations.We demonstrate that MGR, guided by physics and theory in block preconditioning, can tackle several distinct and challenging problems, notably: a hybrid discretization of single-phase flow, compositional multiphase flow with complex wells, and hydraulic fracturing simulations.Extension to other systems can be handled quite naturally. We demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the resulting solvers through numerical examples of difficult, field-scale problems.	preconditioning | algebraic multigrid | hydraulic fracturing | compositional flow | mimetic finite difference method

Zheludev	Optoelectronics Research Centre and Centre for Photonic Metamaterials University of Southampton Southampton SO17 1BJ United Kingdom		Ultrafast vectorially polarized pulses have found many applications in information and energy transfer owing mainly to the presence of strong longitudinal components and their space-polarization non-separability. Due to their broad spectrum, such pulses often exhibit space-time couplings, which significantly affect the pulse propagation dynamics leading to reduced energy density or utilized to create new effects like a rotating or sliding wavefront at focus. Here, we present a new method for the spatio-temporal characterization of ultrashort cylindrical vector pulses based on a combination of spatially resolved Fourier transform spectroscopy and Mach-Zehnder interferometry. The method provides access to spatially resolved spectral amplitudes and phases of all polarization components of the pulse. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method by completely characterizing afs radially polarized pulse from a Ti:sapphire laser atnm.	
[2101.11652] The Evolution of NGC 7465 as Revealed by its Molecular Gas Properties	Lisa M. Young David S. Meier Martin Bureau Alison Crocker Timothy A. Davis Selçuk Topal	Physics Department New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology 801 Leroy Place Socorro NM 87801 USAAdjunct Astronomer National Radio Astronomy Observatory Socorro NM 87801 USA		We present ALMA observations of CO isotopologues and high-density molecular tracers (HCN, HCO, CN, etc.) in NGC 7465, an unusually gas-rich early-type galaxy that acquired its cold gas recently. In the inner 300 pc, the molecular gas kinematics are misaligned with respect to all other galaxy components; as the gas works its way inward it is torqued into polar orbits about the stellar kinematically-decoupled core (KDC), indicating that the stellar KDC is not related to the current gas accretion event. The galaxy also exhibits unusually highCO/CO line ratios in its nucleus but typicalCO/CO ratios. Our calculations show that this result does not necessarily indicate an unusual [CO/CO] abundance ratio but rather thatCO (1-0) is optically thin due to high temperatures and/or large linewidths associated with the inner decoupled, misaligned molecular structure. Line ratios of the higher-density tracers suggest that the densest phase of molecular gas in NGC 7465 has a lower density than is typical for nearby galaxies, possibly as a result of the recent gas accretion. All of the observed molecular properties of NGC 7465 are consistent with it having acquired its molecular (and atomic) gas from a spiral galaxy. Further detailed studies of the CO isotopologues in other early-type galaxies would be valuable for investigating the histories of those that may have acquired their gas from dwarfs. Finally, these ALMA data also show an unidentified line source that is probably a background galaxy similar to those found atin blind CO surveys.

We propose techniques to break the adversarial toleration threshold barrier previously known in coded computing. More specifically, we leverage list-decoding techniques for folded Reed-Solomon codes and propose novel algorithms to recover the correct codeword using side information. In the coded computing setting, we show how the master node can perform certain carefully designed extra computations to obtain the side information. The workload of computing this side information is negligible compared to the computations done by each worker. This side information is then utilized to prune the output of the list decoder and uniquely recover the true outcome. We further propose folded Lagrange coded computing (FLCC) to incorporate the developed techniques into a specific coded computing setting. Our results show that FLCC outperforms LCC by breaking the barrier on the number of adversaries that can be tolerated. In particular, the corresponding threshold in FLCC is improved by a factor of two asymptotically compared to that of LCC.

Middleton		bri@virginia.edu	We estimate the black hole spin parameter in GRS 1915+105 using the continuum-fitting method with revised mass and inclination constraints based on the very long baseline interferometric parallax measurement of the distance to this source. We fit Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations selected to be accretion disk-dominated spectral states as described in McClinotck et al. (2006) and Middleton et al. (2006), which previously gave discrepant spin estimates with this method. We find that, using the new system parameters, the spin in both datasets increased, providing a best-fit spin offor the Middleton et al. data and a poor fit for the McClintock et al. dataset, which becomes pegged at the BHSPEC model limit of. We explore the impact of the uncertainties in the system parameters, showing that the best-fit spin ranges fromto 0.99 for the Middleton et al. dataset and allows reasonable fits to the McClintock et al. dataset with near maximal spin for system distances greater thankpc. We discuss the uncertainties and implications of these estimates.

Goldman William Ulrich Karen F. Berman Giuseppe Blasi Leonardo Fazio Antonio Rampino Alessandro Bertolino Daniel R. Weinberger Venkata S. Mattay Archana Venkataraman	Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Johns Hopkins University USA		We propose a novel deep neural network architecture to integrate imaging and genetics data, as guided by diagnosis, that provides interpretable biomarkers. Our model consists of an encoder, a decoder and a classifier. The encoder learns a non-linear subspace shared between the input data modalities. The classifier and the decoder act as regularizers to ensure that the low-dimensional encoding captures predictive differences between patients and controls. We use a learnable dropout layer to extract interpretable biomarkers from the data, and our unique training strategy can easily accommodate missing data modalities across subjects. We have evaluated our model on a population study of schizophrenia that includes two functional MRI (fMRI) paradigms and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data. Using 10-fold cross validation, we demonstrate that our model achieves better classification accuracy than baseline methods, and that this performance generalizes to a second dataset collected at a different site. In an exploratory analysis we further show that the biomarkers identified by our model are closely associated with the well-documented deficits in schizophrenia.

ZhaoSchool of Mathematics and StatisticsCarleton University, Ottawa, ON Canada K1S 5B6			In this paper, we provide a review on the GTH algorithm, which is a numerically stable algorithm for computing stationary probabilities of a Markov chain. Mathematically the GTH algorithm is an rearrangement of Gaussian elimination, and therefore they are mathematically equivalent. All components in the GTH algorithm can be interpreted probabilistically based on the censoring concept and each elimination in the GTH algorithm leads to a censored Markov chain. The-factorization is a counterpart to the LU-decomposition for Gaussian elimination. The censored Markov chain can also be treated as an extended version of the GTH algorithm for a system consisting of infinitely many linear equations. The censored Markov chain produces a minimal error for approximating the original chain under the-norm.

Both authors contributed equally to this work.	cgutierrez@unex.es carmen.minuesa@uam.es	A two-type two-sex branching process is introduced with the aim of describing the interaction of predator and prey populations with sexual reproduction and promiscuous mating. In each generation and in each species the total number of individuals which mate and produce offspring is controlled by a binomial distribution with size given by this number of individuals and probability of success depending on the density of preys per predator. The resulting model enables us to depict the typical cyclic behaviour of predator-prey systems under some mild assumptions on the shape of the function that characterises the probability of survival of the previous binomial distribution. We present some basic results about fixation and extinction of both species as well as conditions for the coexistence of both of them. We also analyse the suitability of the process to model real ecosystems comparing our model with a real dataset.

Particularly, Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) compatible modelshave been developed forthe lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO) battery storageusing theSpecial Order Sets 2to represent the nonlinear characteristics, includingefficiency, internal resistance growth, and capacity fade. Such formulation can be used in problems related to various applications, i.e., power systems, smart grid, and vehicular applications, and it allows finding the globally optimal solution using off-the-shelf academic and commercial solvers. In the numerical study, the proposed modelling approach has been applied to realistic scenarios of peak-shaving, where the importance of considering the developed models is explicitly demonstrated.Operation- and degradation-aware techno-economic analysis showed that the optimal battery capacity is driven by operating rather than service requirements. Particularly, a considerable battery over-sizing becomes economically feasible when the battery storage is used more extensively. Another finding suggests that to achieve the maximum value from battery storage, its operation strategy needs to be significantly modified during the course of its lifetime. In the scenarios considered, the charging time gradually increased from four to seven hours, while the average SoC decreased by 20%.Such an adaptable scheduling results in reduced battery degradation and a longer lifetime, which may provideas much as12.1% of savings in the battery storage system project.

[2101.11660] Long-range order in quadrupolar systems on spherical surfaces	Andraž Gnidovec and Simon ČoparUniversity of Ljubljana, Faculty of Mathematics and PhysicsSI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia			Understanding the interplay between topology and ordering in systems on curved manifolds, governed by anisotropic interactions, takes a central role in many fields of physics. In this paper, we investigate the effects of lattice symmetry and local positional order on orientational ordering in systems of long-range interacting point quadrupoles on a sphere in the zero temperature limit. Locally triangular spherical lattices show long-range ordered quadrupolar configurations only for specific symmetric lattices as strong geometric frustration prevents general global ordering. Conversely, the ground states on Caspar-Klug lattices are more diverse, with many different symmetries depending on the position of quadrupoles within the fundamental domain. We also show that by constraining the quadrupole tilts with respect to the surface normal, which models interactions with the substrate, and by considering general quadrupole tensors, we can manipulate the ground state configuration symmetry.	
[2101.11661] Kernel Method — An Analytic Approach for Tail Asymptotics in Stationary Probabilities of 2-Dimensional Queueing Systems	Yiqiang Q. ZhaoSchool of Mathematics and StatisticsCarleton University, Ottawa, ON Canada K1S 5B6			In this paper, we provide a review on the kernel method, which is one of the options for characterizing so-called exact tail asymptotic properties in stationary probabilities of two-dimensional random walks, discrete or continuous (or mixed), in the quarter plane. Many two-dimensional queueing systems can be modelled via these types of random walks. Stationary probabilities are one of the most sought statistical quantities in queueing analysis. However, explicit expressions are available only for a very limited number of models. Therefore, tail asymptotic properties become more important, since they provide insightful information into the structure of the tail probabilities, and often lead to approximations, performance bounds, algorithms, among possible others.

Sansone 1 I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino Italy	filippo.caruso@unifi.it susana.huelga@uni-ulm.de gherardini@lens.unifi.it andrea.smirne@unimi.it	The non-Markovianity of an arbitrary open quantum system is analyzed in reference to the multi-time statistics given by its monitoring at discrete times. On the one hand, we exploit the hierarchy of inhomogeneous transfer tensors, which provides us with relevant information about the role of correlations between the system and the environment in the dynamics. The connection between the transfer-tensor hierarchy and the CP-divisibility property is then investigated, by showing to what extent quantum Markovianity can be linked to a description of the open-system dynamics by means of the composition of 1-step transfer tensors only. On the other hand, we introduce the set of stochastic transfer tensor transformations associated with local measurements on the open system at different times and conditioned on the measurement outcomes. The use of the transfer-tensor formalism accounts for different kinds of memory effects in the multi-time statistics and allows us to compare them on a similar footing with the memory effects present in non-monitored non-Markovian dynamics, as we illustrate on a spin-boson case study.

Our proof applies to the new variant incorporating a general class of surface tensions and mobilities, including typical choices for modeling grain growth. The basis of the proof are the minimizing movements interpretation of Esedoğlu and Otto and De Giorgi’s general theory of gradient flows. Under a typical energy convergence assumption we show that the limit satisfies a sharp energy-dissipation relation.	
[2101.11664] Vortex Ordering and Dynamics on Santa Fe Artificial Ice Pinning Arrays	Wenzhao Li C. J. O. Reichhardt B. Jankó C. Reichhardt	Department of Physics University of Notre Dame Notre Dame Indiana 46656	cjrx@lanl.gov	We numerically examine the ordering, pinning and flow of superconducting vortices interacting with a Santa Fe artificial ice pinning array. We find that as a function of magnetic field and pinning density, a wide variety of vortex states occur, including ice rule obeying states and labyrinthine patterns. In contrast to square pinning arrays, we find no sharp peaks in the critical current due to the inherent frustration effect imposed by the Santa Fe ice geometry; however, there are some smoothed peaks when the number of vortices matches the number of pinning sites. For some fillings, the Santa Fe array exhibits stronger pinning than the square array due to the suppression of one-dimensional flow channels when the vortex motion in the Santa Fe lattice occurs through the formation of both longitudinal and transverse flow channels.	
[2101.11665] On Statistical Bias In Active Learning: How and When to Fix It	Sebastian Farquhar, Yarin Gal, Tom RainforthUniversity of Oxford,OATML, Department of Computer Science;Department of Statistics	Equal contribution. Corresponding	sebastian.farquhar@cs.ox.ac.uk	Active learning is a powerful tool when labelling data is expensive, but it introduces a bias because the training data no longer follows the population distribution. We formalize this bias and investigate the situations in which it can be harmful and sometimes even helpful. We further introduce novel corrective weights to remove bias when doing so is beneficial. Through this, our work not only provides a useful mechanism that can improve the active learning approach, but also an explanation of the empirical successes of various existing approaches which ignore this bias. In particular, we show that this bias can be actively helpful when training overparameterized models—like neural networks—with relatively little data.

We prove by means of the dynamic programming principle (DPP) that the lower and upper value functions are continuous and viscosity solutions to the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) quasi-variational inequality (QVI). We define a new HJBI QVI for which, under a proportional property assumption on the maximizer cost, the value functions are the unique viscosity solution. We then prove that the lower and upper value functions coincide.

Wyant College of Optical SciencesUniversity of ArizonaTucson AZ 	dingy@email.arizona.edu ashoka@email.arizona.edu	The data for many classification problems, such as pattern and speech recognition, follow mixture distributions. To quantify the optimum performance for classification tasks, the Shannon mutual information is a natural information-theoretic metric, as it is directly related to the probability of error. The mutual information between mixture data and the class label does not have an analytical expression, nor any efficient computational algorithms. We introduce a variational upper bound, a lower bound, and three estimators, all employing pair-wise divergences between mixture components. We compare the new bounds and estimators with Monte Carlo stochastic sampling and bounds derived from entropy bounds. To conclude, we evaluate the performance of the bounds and estimators through numerical simulations.

of detectable gravitational-wave signals, and provided confirmation of all observed gravitational-wave events. In this work, we present the methods used to characterize the LIGO detectors and curate the publicly available datasets, including the LIGO strain data and data quality products. We describe the essential role of these datasets in LIGO-Virgo Collaboration analyses of gravitational-waves from both transient and persistent sources and include details on the provenance of these datasets in order to support analyses of LIGO data by the broader community. Finally, we explain anticipated changes in the role of detector characterization and current efforts to prepare for the high rate of gravitational-wave alerts and events in future observing runs.	
[2101.11674] LS-HDIB: A Large Scale Handwritten Document Image Binarization Dataset		footnotetext:		Handwritten document image binarization is challenging due to high variability in the written content and complex background attributes such as page style, paper quality, stains, shadow gradients, and non-uniform illumination. While the traditional thresholding methods do not effectively generalize on such challenging real-world scenarios, deep learning-based methods have performed relatively well when provided with sufficient training data. However, the existing datasets are limited in size and diversity. This work proposes LS-HDIB - a large-scale handwritten document image binarization dataset containing over a million document images that span numerous real-world scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a novel technique that uses a combination of adaptive thresholding and seamless cloning methods to create the dataset with accurate ground truths. Through an extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation over eight different deep learning based models, we demonstrate the enhancement in the performance of these models when trained on the LS-HDIB dataset and tested on unseen images.

A sample of 46 stars, host of exoplanets, is used to search for a connection between their formation process and the formation of the planets rotating around them. Separating our sample in two, stars hosting high-mass exoplanets (HMEs) and low-mass exoplanets (LMEs), we found the former to be more massive and to rotate faster than the latter. We also found the HMEs to have higher orbital angular momentum than the LMEs and to have lost more angular momentum through migration. These results are consistent with the view that the more massive the star and higher its rotation, the more massive was its protoplanetarys disk and rotation, and the more efficient the extraction of angular momentum from the planets.

Analytic continuation of these results is impossible even for slightly deformed Lorentzian distributions, due to the divergence of all the moments (cumulants). We have solved this problem by introducing apseudo-cumulants’expansion. This allows us to develop a reduction methodology for heterogeneous spiking neural networks subject to extrinsinc and endogenous noise sources, thus generalizing the mean-field formulation introduced in [E. Montbrióet al., Phys. Rev. X 5, 021028 (2015)].

Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is one of the most powerful techniques for imaging deep within tissue – well beyond the conventional10-15 mean scattering lengths tolerated by ballistic imaging techniques such as confocal and two-photon microscopy. Unfortunately, existing DOT systems are limited, achieving only centimeter-scale resolution. Furthermore, they suffer from slow acquisition times and slow reconstruction speeds making real-time imaging infeasible. We show that time-of-flight diffuse optical tomography (ToF-DOT) and its confocal variant (CToF-DOT), by exploiting the photon travel time information, allow us to achieve millimeter spatial resolution in the highly scattered diffusion regime (mean free paths). In addition, we demonstrate two additional innovations: focusing on confocal measurements, and multiplexing the illumination sources allow us to significantly reduce the measurement acquisition time. Finally, we rely on a novel convolutional approximation that allows us to develop a fast reconstruction algorithm, achieving a 100speedup in reconstruction time compared to traditional DOT reconstruction techniques. Together, we believe that these technical advances serve as the first step towards real-time, millimeter resolution, deep tissue imaging using DOT.

The proposed framework enables the terrestrial MUs to offload their computational tasks simultaneously, intelligently, and flexibly, thus enhancing their connectivity as well as reducing their transmission latency and their energy consumption. To this end, the fundamentals of this framework are first introduced. Then, a number of communication and AI techniques are proposed to improve the quality of experiences of terrestrial MUs. To this end, federated learning and reinforcement learning are introduced for intelligent task offloading and computing resources allocation. For each learning technique, motivations, challenges, and representative results are introduced. Finally, several key technical challenges and open research issues of the proposed framework are summarized.

While frequentist nonparametric and Bayesian parametric methods have been proposed to precisely estimate the entire distribution of reactive inhibition, quantified by stop signal reaction times(SSRT), there is no method yet in the stop-signal task literature to precisely estimate the entire distribution of proactive inhibition. We introduce an Asymmetric Laplace Gaussian (ALG) model to describe the distribution of proactive inhibition. The proposed method is based on two assumptions of independent trial type(go/stop) reaction times and Ex-Gaussian (ExG) models. Results indicated that the four parametric, ALG model uniquely describes the proactive inhibition distribution and its key shape features; and, its hazard function is monotonically increasing, as are its three parametric ExG components. In conclusion, both response inhibition components can be uniquely modeled via variations of the four parametric ALG model described with their associated similar distributional features.

[2101.11684] Hybrid Neural Pareto Front (HNPF): A Two-Stage Neural-Filter Approach for Pareto Front Extraction	Gurpreet Singh† Soumyajit Gupta† Matthew Lease Clint Dawson	The University of Texas at Austin		Pareto solutions represent optimal frontiers for jointly optimizing multiple competing objective functions over the feasible set of solutions satisfying imposed constraints. Extracting a Pareto front is computationally challenging today with limited scalability and solution accuracy. Popular generic scalarization approaches do not always converge to a global optimum and can only return one solution point per run. Consequently, multiple runs of a scalarization problem are required to guarantee a Pareto front, where all instances must converge to their respective global optima. We propose a robust, low cost hybrid Pareto neural-filter (HNPF) optimization approach that is accurate and scales (compute space and time) with data dimensions, and the number of functions and constraints. A first-stage neural network first efficiently extracts aweakPareto front, using Fritz-John conditions as the discriminator, with no assumptions of convexity on the objectives or constraints. A second-stage, low-cost Pareto filter then extracts thestrongPareto optimal subset from theweakfront. Fritz-John conditions provide strong theoretical bounds on approximation error between the true and the network extractedweakPareto front. Numerical experiments demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of our approach.

Hine	thanks:	s.loh@warwick.ac.uk neil.wilson@warwick.ac.uk n.d.m.hine@warwick.ac.uk x.xia@warwick.ac.uk	We study the electronic properties of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide materials subjected to aliovalent doping, using Nb-doped WSas an exemplar. Scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging of the as-grown samples reveals an anisotropic Nb dopant distribution, prompting an investigation of anisotropy in electronic properties. Through electronic structure calculations on supercells representative of observed structures, we confirm that local Nb-atom distributions are consistent with energetic considerations, although kinetic processes occurring during sample growth must be invoked to explain the overall symmetry-breaking. We perform effective bandstructure and conductivity calculations on realistic models of the material that demonstrate that a high level of anisotropy can be expected in electronic properties including conductivity. In-plane anisotropy of the conductivity is predicted to be as high as 5:1, which is higher than previously observed in any TMDC system in the [Mo,W][S,Se]class.

We plan to use the instrument to conduct the NEID Earth Twin Survey (NETS) over the course of the next 5 years, collecting hundreds of observations of some of the nearest and brightest stars in an effort to probe the regime of Earth-mass exoplanets. Even if we take advantage of the extreme instrumental precision conferred by NEID, it will remain difficult to disentangle the weak (10 cm s) signals induced by such low-mass, long-period exoplanets from stellar noise for all but the quietest host stars. In this work, we present a set of quantitative selection metrics which we use to identify an initial NETS target list consisting of stars conducive to the detection of exoplanets in the regime of interest. We also outline a set of observing strategies with which we aim to mitigate uncertainty contributions from intrinsic stellar variability and other sources of noise.	exoplanet detection methods: radial velocity — stellar properties — surveys

While for corresponding local elliptic equations with VMO coefficients it is only possible to obtain higher integrability, in our nonlocal setting we are able to also prove a substantial amount of higher differentiability, so that our result is in some sense of purely nonlocal type. By embedding, we also obtain higher Hölder regularity for such nonlocal equations.

[2101.11692] RGE effects on the LFV scale from meson decays	Marcela González Sergey Kovalenko Nicolás A. Neill Jonatan Vignatti	affiliationtext:		We consider the lepton-flavor violating (LFV) lepton-quark dimension-6 operators and analyze their contributions to the LFV leptonic decays of vector, pseudoscalar, and scalar neutral mesonsas well as todecays. These operators contribute to the purely leptonic processes via quark loop. On the basis of quark-hadron duality, we relate these loops to the appropriate meson-exchange contributions. In this way, we extract lower bounds on the individual scales of the studied LFV operators from the experimental and phenomenological limits on the leptonic decays of mesons and leptons. As a byproduct, we shall obtain new limits on the LFV leptonic decays of flavored mesons from the experimental bounds on the three-body lepton decays. We study the effects of QED and QCD radiative corrections to the LFV lepton-quark operators in question. We derive for them the one-loop matrix of the RGE evolution and examine its effect on the previously derived tree-level limits on these operators. We show that the QED corrections are particularly relevant due to operator mixing. Specifically, for some of them the limits on their individual LFV scales improve by up to 3 orders of magnitude.

The amplifier is based on a ladder transmission line consisting of flux-biased radio-frequency SQUIDs whose nonlinearity is of-type. QPM is achieved in the 3WM process,(where,, andare the pump, signal, and idler frequencies, respectively) due to designing the JTWPA to include periodically inverted groups of these SQUIDs that reverse the sign of the nonlinearity. Modeling shows that the JTWPA bandwidth is relatively large (ca.) and flat, while unwanted modes, including,,, etc., are strongly suppressed with the help of engineered dispersion.

Within our work, we use this result as a starting point, aiming towards understanding the physics of by a large angle twisted double layer graphene (i.e. Moire) quantum dot systems. We show that within this simple approach using the language of the first quantization, yet another so far unrealized (not up to our knowledge), illustrative property of the commutation relation appears in the graphene physics. Intriguingly, large twisting angles show to be a suitable tunning knob of the position symmetry in the graphene systems. Complete overview of the large angle twisting on the considered dot systems is provided.

[2101.11700] Multi-Modal Aesthetic Assessment for MObile Gaming Image				With the proliferation of various gaming technology, services, game styles, and platforms, multi-dimensional aesthetic assessment of the gaming contents is becoming more and more important for the gaming industry. Depending on the diverse needs of diversified game players, game designers, graphical developers,etc.in particular conditions, multi-modal aesthetic assessment is required to consider different aesthetic dimensions/perspectives. Since there are different underlying relationships between different aesthetic dimensions,e.g.,between the ‘Colorfulness’ and ‘Color Harmony’, it could be advantageous to leverage effective information attached in multiple relevant dimensions. To this end, we solve this problem via multi-task learning. Our inclination is to seek and learn the correlations between different aesthetic relevant dimensions to further boost the generalization performance in predicting all the aesthetic dimensions. Therefore, the ‘bottleneck’ of obtaining good predictions with limited labeled data for one individual dimension could be unplugged by harnessing complementary sources of other dimensions,i.e.,augment the training data indirectly by sharing training information across dimensions. According to experimental results, the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art aesthetic metrics significantly in predicting four gaming aesthetic dimensions.	
[2101.11701] Eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius operator and the finite-time Lyapunov exponents in uniformly hyperbolic area-preserving maps	Kensuke Yoshida, Hajime Yoshino, Akira Shudoand Domenico Lippolis	Department of Physics Tokyo Metropolitan University Minami-Osawa Hachioji Tokyo 192-0397 JapanInstitute for Applied Systems Analysis Jiangsu University 212013 Zhenjiang 	domenico@ujs.edu.cn	The subleading eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius operator for 2-dimensional area-preserving maps are numerically investigated. We closely examine the validity of the so-called Ulam method, a numerical scheme believed to provide eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius operator, both for linear and nonlinear maps on the torus. For the nonlinear case, the second-largest eigenvalues and the associated eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius operator are investigated by calculating the Fokker-Planck operator with sufficiently small diffusivity. On the basis of numerical schemes thus established, we find that eigenfunctions for the subleading eigenvalues exhibit spatially inhomogeneous patterns, especially showing localization around the region where unstable manifolds are sparsely running. Finally, such spatial patterns of the eigenfunction are shown to be very close to the distribution of the maximal finite-time Lyapunov exponents.	
[2101.11702] Better sampling in explanation methods can prevent dieselgate-like deception	Domen Vreš, Marko Robnik-ŠikonjaUniversity of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information ScienceVečna pot 113, 1000 Ljubljana,		domen.vres@siol.net marko.robnik@fri.uni-lj.si	Machine learning models are used in many sensitive areas where, besides predictive accuracy, their comprehensibility is also important. Interpretability of prediction models is necessary to determine their biases and causes of errors and is a prerequisite for users’ confidence. For complex state-of-the-art black-box models, post-hoc model-independent explanation techniques are an established solution. Popular and effective techniques, such as IME, LIME, and SHAP, use perturbation of instance features to explain individual predictions. Recently,Slack et al. (2020)put their robustness into question by showing that their outcomes can be manipulated due to poor perturbation sampling employed. This weakness would allow dieselgate type cheating of owners of sensitive models who could deceive inspection and hide potentially unethical or illegal biases existing in their predictive models. This could undermine public trust in machine learning models and give rise to legal restrictions on their use.

As a popular self-supervised learning method, contrastive learning has recently garnered considerable attention. In this study, we proposed a unified framework based on a new perspective of contrastive learning (CL) that is suitable for both unsupervised and supervised feature extraction. The proposed framework first constructed two CL graph for uniquely defining the positive and negative pairs. Subsequently, the projection matrix was determined by minimizing the contrastive loss function. In addition, the proposed framework considered both similar and dissimilar samples to unify unsupervised and supervised feature extraction. Moreover, we propose the three specific methods: unsupervised contrastive learning method, supervised contrastive learning method 1 ,and supervised contrastive learning method 2. Finally, the numerical experiments on five real datasets demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed framework in comparison to the existing methods.	feature extraction | dimension reduction | self-supervised learning | contrastive learning

Kakadiaris, Thamar SolorioDepartment of Computer Science, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA			In this work, we explore different approaches to combine modalities for the problem of automated age-suitability rating of movie trailers. First, we introduce a new dataset containing videos of movie trailers in English downloaded from IMDB and YouTube, along with their corresponding age-suitability rating labels. Secondly, we propose a multi-modal deep learning pipeline addressing the movie trailer age suitability rating problem. This is the first attempt to combine video, audio, and speech information for this problem, and our experimental results show that multi-modal approaches significantly outperform the best mono and bimodal models in this task.

[2101.11707] Knowledge-driven Natural Language Understanding of English Text and its ApplicationsAuthors partially supported by NSF grants IIS 1718945, IIS 1910131, and IIP 1916206	Kinjal Basu, Sarat Varanasi, Farhad Shakerin, Joaquin Ariasand Gopal GuptaDepartment of Computer ScienceArtificial Intelligence Research GroupThe University of Texas at Dallas, USA Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain	thanks:		Understanding the meaning of a text is a fundamental challenge of natural language understanding (NLU) research. An ideal NLU system should process a language in a way that is not exclusive to a single task or a dataset. Keeping this in mind, we have introduced a novel knowledge driven semantic representation approach for English text. By leveraging the VerbNet lexicon, we are able to map syntax tree of the text to its commonsense meaning represented using basic knowledge primitives. The general purpose knowledge represented from our approach can be used to build any reasoning based NLU system that can also provide justification. We applied this approach to construct two NLU applications that we present here: SQuARE (Semantic-based Question Answering and Reasoning Engine) and StaCACK (Stateful Conversational Agent using Commonsense Knowledge). Both these systems work by “truly understanding” the natural language text they process and both provide natural language explanations for their responses while maintaining high accuracy.	
[2101.11708] A Cable Knot and BPS-Series	John Chae	UC Davis 1 Shields Ave Davis CA 95616 	yjchae@ucdavis.edu	A series invariant of a complement of a knot was introduced recently. The invariant for several prime knots up to ten crossings have been explicitly computed. We present the first example of a satellite knot, namely, a cable of the figure eight knot, which has more than ten crossings. This cable knot result provides nontrivial evidence for the conjectures for the series invariant and demonstrates the robustness of integrality of the quantum invariant under the cabling operation. Furthermore, we observe a relation between the series invariant of the cable knot and the series invariant of the figure eight knot. This relation provides an alternative simple method of finding the former series invariant.

Kirian	Department of PhysicsArizona State UniversityTempe AZ 85287 USA		We develop an algorithm capable of imaging a three-dimensional object given a collection of two-dimensional images of that object that are significantly influenced by the curvature of the Ewald sphere. These two-dimensional images cannot be approximated as projections of the object. Such an algorithm is useful in cryo-electron microscopy where larger samples, higher resolution, or lower energy electron beams are desired, all of which contribute to the significance of Ewald curvature.

Mining such literature can reveal trends that may not be immediately apparent. The CORD-19 corpus represents a growing corpus of scientific literature associated with COVID-19. We examined the intersection of a set of candidate therapeutics identified in a drug-repurposing study with temporal instances of the CORD-19 corpus to determine if it was possible to find and measure changes associated with them over time. We propose that the techniques we used could form the basis of a tool to pre-screen new candidate therapeutics early in the research process.	
[2101.11711] Damage detection in operational wind turbine blades using a new approach based on machine learning	Kartik Chandrasekhar Nevena Stevanovic Elizabeth J. Cross Nikolaos Dervilis Keith Worden		k.chandrasekhar@sheffield.ac.uk	The application of reliable structural health monitoring (SHM) technologies to operational wind turbine blades is a challenging task, due to the uncertain nature of the environments they operate in. In this paper, a novel SHM methodology, which uses Gaussian Processes (GPs) is proposed. The methodology takes advantage of the fact that the blades on a turbine are nominally identical in structural properties and encounter the same environmental and operational variables (EOVs). The properties of interest are the first edgewise frequencies of the blades. The GPs are used to predict the edge frequencies of one blade given that of another, after these relationships between the pairs of blades have been learned when the blades are in a healthy state. In using this approach, the proposed SHM methodology is able to identify when the blades start behaving differently from one another over time. To validate the concept, the proposed SHM system is applied to real onshore wind turbine blade data, where some form of damage was known to have taken place. X-bar control chart analysis of the residual errors between the GP predictions and actual frequencies show that the system successfully identified early onset of damage as early as six months before it was identified and remedied.	structural health monitoring | wind turbine blades | machine learning | Gaussian processes | SCADA
[2101.11712] Predicting the Mechanical Properties of Biopolymer Gels Using Neural Networks Trained on Discrete Fiber Network Data	Yue Leng,Vahidullah Tac, Sarah Calveand Adrian B Tepole	Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering Purdue University West Lafayette IN USADepartment of Mechanical Engineering Colorado University Boulder CO USASchool of Mechanical Engineering Purdue University West Lafayette IN USA		Biopolymer gels, such as those made out of fibrin or collagen, are widely used in tissue engineering applications and biomedical research. Moreover, fibrin naturally assembles into gelsin vivoduring wound healing and thrombus formation. The macroscaole properties of fibrin and otherbiopolymergels are dictated by the response of a microscale fiber network. Hence, accurate description ofbiopolymergels can be achieved using representative volume elements (RVE) that explicitly model the discrete fiber networks of the microscale. These RVE models, however, cannot be efficiently used to model the macroscale due to the challenges and computational demands of multiscale coupling. Here, we propose the use of an artificial, fully connected neural network (FCNN) to efficiently capture the behavior of the RVE models. The FCNN was trained on 1100 fiber networks subjected to 121 biaxial deformations. The stress data from the RVE, together with the total energy on the fibers and the condition of incompressibility of the surrounding matrix, were used to determine the derivatives of an unknown strain energy function with respect to the deformation invariants. During training, the loss function was modified to ensure convexity of the strain energy function and symmetry of its Hessian. A general FCNN model was coded into a user material subroutine (UMAT) in the software Abaqus. The UMAT implementation takes in the structure and parameters of an arbitrary FCNN as material parameters from the input file. The inputs to the FCNN include the first two isochoric invariants of the deformation. The FCNN outputs the derivatives of the strain energy with respect to the isochoric invariants. In this work, the FCNN trained on the discrete fiber network data was used in finite element simulations ofbiopolymergels using our UMAT. We anticipate that this work will enable further integration of machine learning tools with computational mechanics. It will also improve computational modeling of biological materials characterized by a multiscale structure.

[2101.11715] Failure Prediction in Production Line Based on Federated Learning: An Empirical Study	Ning Ge Guanghao Li Li Zhang Yi Liu	institutetext:	liguanghao@buaa.edu.cn lily@buaa.edu.cn gening@buaa.edu.cn zy1906505@buaa.edu.cn	Data protection across organizations is limiting the application of centralized learning (CL) techniques. Federated learning (FL) enables multiple participants to build a learning model without sharing data. Nevertheless, there is very few research works on FL in intelligent manufacturing. This paper presents the results of an empirical study on failure prediction in the production line based on FL. This paper (1) designs Federated Support Vector Machine (FedSVM) and Federated Random Forest (FedRF) algorithms for the horizontal FL and vertical FL scenarios, respectively; (2) proposes an experiment process for evaluating the effectiveness between the FL and CL algorithms; (3) finds that the performance of FL and CL are not significantly different on the global testing data, on the random partial testing data, and on the estimated unknown Bosch data, respectively. The fact that the testing data is heterogeneous enhances our findings. Our study reveals that FL can replace CL for failure prediction.

[2101.11718] BOLD: Dataset and Metrics for Measuring Biases in Open-Ended Language Generation	Jwala Dhamala Tony Sun Varun Kumar Satyapriya Krishna Yada Pruksachatkun Kai-Wei Chang Rahul Gupta	Amazon Alexa AI-NUUSA		Recent advances in deep learning techniques have enabled machines to generate cohesive open-ended text when prompted with a sequence of words as context. While these models now empower many downstream applications from conversation bots to automatic storytelling, they have been shown to generate texts that exhibit social biases. To systematically study and benchmark social biases in open-ended language generation, we introduce the Bias in Open-Ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD), a large-scale dataset that consists of 23,679 English text generation prompts for bias benchmarking across five domains: profession, gender, race, religion, and political ideology. We also propose new automated metrics for toxicity, psycholinguistic norms, and text gender polarity to measure social biases in open-ended text generation from multiple angles. An examination of text generated from three popular language models reveals that the majority of these models exhibit a larger social bias than human-written Wikipedia text across all domains. With these results we highlight the need to benchmark biases in open-ended language generation and caution users of language generation models on downstream tasks to be cognizant of these embedded prejudices.

Moscow 119991 Russia Plekhanov Russian University of Economics Stremyanny per. 36. 117997 Moscow Russia	yukosevich@gmail.com 20yukosevich@gmail.com	We present a study of the wrinkling modes, localized in the plane of single- and few-layer graphene sheets embedded in or placed on a compliant compressively strained matrix. We provide the analytical model based on nonlinear elasticity of the graphene sheet, which shows that the compressive surface stress results in spatial localization of the extended sinusoidal wrinkling mode with soliton-like envelope with localization length, decreasing with the overcritical external strain. The parameters of the extended sinusoidal wrinkling modes are found from the conditions of anomalous softening of flexural surface acoustic wave propagating along the graphene sheet in or on the matrix. For relatively small overcritical external strain, the continuous transition occurs from the sinusoidal wrinkling modes with soliton-like envelope to the strongly localized modes with approximately one-period sinusoidal profiles and amplitude- and external-strain-independent spatial widths. Two types of graphene wrinkling modes with different symmetry are described, when the in-plane antisymmetric or symmetric modes are presumably realized in the graphene sheet embedded in or placed on a compliant strained matrix. Strongly localized wrinkling modes can be realized without delamination of the graphene sheet from the compliant matrix and are not equivalent to the ripplocations in layered solids. Molecular-dynamics modeling confirms the appearance of sinusoidal wrinkling modes in single- and few-layer graphene sheets embedded in polyethylene matrix at.

One of the emerging trends in this endeavor are the Electric Vehicles (EVs), which use electricity instead of traditional fossil fuels as a power source, relying on the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) paradigm. The novelty of such a paradigm requires careful analysis to avoid malicious attempts. An attacker can exploit several surfaces, such as the remote connection between the Distribution Grid and Charging Supply or the authentication system between the charging Supply Equipment and the Electric Vehicles. However, V2G architecture’s high cost and complexity in implementation can restrain this field’s research capability.

In the setting, there is a set of projects (each with its own cost) and a set of agents (that have their budgets as well as preferences over the projects). An outcome is a set of projects that are funded along with the specific contributions made by the agents. For the model, we identify meaningful axioms that capture concerns including fairness, efficiency, and participation incentives. We then propose desirable rules for the model and study, which sets of axioms can be satisfied simultaneously. An experimental study indicates the relative performance of different rules as well as the price of enforcing fairness axioms.

Halpern Y. Hua Q. Xie C.-T. Chen C.-M. Kao	footnotetext:		Precise quantitative delineation of tumor hypoxia is essential in radiation therapy treatment planning to improve the treatment efficacy by targeting hypoxic sub-volumes. We developed a combined imaging system of positron emission tomography (PET) and electron para-magnetic resonance imaging (EPRI) of molecular oxygen to investigate the accuracy of PET imaging in assessing tumor hypoxia. The PET/EPRI combined imaging system aims to use EPRI to precisely measure the oxygen partial pressure in tissues. This will evaluate the validity of PET hypoxic tumor imaging by (near) simultaneously acquired EPRI as ground truth. The combined imaging system was constructed by integrating a small animal PET scanner (inner ring diameter 62 mm and axial field of view 25.6 mm) and an EPRI subsystem (field strength 25 mT and resonant frequency 700 MHz). The compatibility between the PET and EPRI subsystems were tested with both phantom and animal imaging. Hypoxic imaging on a tumor mouse model usingF-fluoromisonidazole radio-tracer was conducted with the developed PET/EPRI system. We report the development and initial imaging results obtained from the PET/EPRI combined imaging system.

[2101.11727] Characterising Fixed Parameter Tractability of Query Evaluation Over Guarded TGDs	Cristina Feier	institutetext:		We study the parameterized complexity of evaluating Ontology Mediated Queries (OMQs) based on Guarded TGDs (GTGDs) and Unions of Conjunctive Queries (UCQs), in the case where relational symbols have unrestricted arity and where the parameter is the size of the OMQ. We establish exact criteria for fixed-parameter tractability (fpt) evaluation of recursively enumerable classes of such OMQs (under the widely held Exponential Time Hypothesis). One of the main technical tools introduced in the paper is an fpt-reduction from deciding parameterized uniform CSPs to parameterized OMQ evaluation. The reduction preserves measures which are known to be essential for classifying recursively enumerable classes of parameterized uniform CSPs: submodular width (according to the well known result of Marx for unrestricted-arity schemas) and treewidth (according to the well known result of Grohe for bounded-arity schemas). As such, it can be employed to obtain hardness results for evaluation of recursively enumerable classes of parameterized OMQs both in the unrestricted and in the bounded arity case. Previously, in the case of bounded arity schemas, this has been tackled using a technique requiring full introspection into the construction employed by Grohe.	
[2101.11728] SimBle - Introducing privacy preserving BLE simulation to generate real-world traces This work has been partially funded by the ANR MITIK project, French National Research Agency (ANR), PRC AAPG2019.).	Abhishek Kumar Mishra12, Aline Carneiro Viana2, Nadjib Achir23, Abhishek Kumar Mishra12, Aline Carneiro Viana2, Nadjib Achir23,	thanks:	nadjib.achir@univ-paris13.fr	Bluetooth has become critical as many IoT devices are arriving in the market. Most of the current literature focusing on Bluetooth simulation concentrates on the network protocols’ performances and completely neglects the privacy protection recommendations introduced in the BLE standard. Indeed, privacy protection is one of the main issues handled in the Bluetooth standard. For instance, the current standard forces devices to change the identifier they embed within the public and private packets, known as MAC address randomization. Although randomizing MAC addresses is intended to preserve device privacy, recent literature shows many challenges that are still present. One of them is the correlation between the public packets and the emitters. Unfortunately, existing evaluation tools such as NS-3 are not designed to reproduce this Bluetooth standard’s essential functionality. This makes it impossible to test solutions for different device-fingerprinting strategies as there is a lack ofground truthfor large-scale scenarios with the majority of current BLE devices implementing MAC address randomization. In this paper, we first introduce a solution of standard-compliant MAC address randomization in the NS-3 framework, capable of emulating any real BLE device in the simulation and generating real-world Bluetooth traces. In addition, since the simulation run-time for trace-collection grows exponentially with the number of devices, we introduce an optimization to linearize public-packet sniffing. This made the large-scale trace-collection practically feasible. Then, we use the generated traces and associated ground truth to do a case study on the evaluation of a generic MAC address association available in the literature[1]. Our case study reveals that close toof randomized addresses could be correctly linked even in highly dense and mobile scenarios. This prompts the BLE standard to be revisited on privacy-related provisions. We provide privacy recommendations based on our case study. Finally, we discuss the consequences that real randomized traces bring to different scientific research domains and how our proposed solution helps in overcoming new challenges.

Govia	Current address: Department of Applied Physics Yale University New Haven CT 06520 USA and Yale Quantum Institute Yale University New Haven CT 06520 	luke.c.govia@raytheon.com william.kalfus@yale.edu	Accelerating computational tasks with quantum resources is a widely-pursued goal that is presently limited by the challenges associated with high-fidelity control of many-body quantum systems. The paradigm of reservoir computing presents an attractive alternative, especially in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, since control over the internal system state and knowledge of its dynamics are not required. Instead, complex, unsupervised internal trajectories through a large state space are leveraged as a computational resource. Quantum systems offer a unique venue for reservoir computing, given the presence of interactions unavailable in analogous classical systems, and the potential for a computational space that grows exponentially with physical system size. Here, we consider a reservoir comprised of a single qudit (-dimensional quantum system). We demonstrate a robust performance advantage compared to an analogous classical system accompanied by a clear improvement with Hilbert space dimension for two benchmark tasks: signal processing and short-term memory capacity. Qudit reservoirs are directly realized by current-era quantum hardware, offering immediate practical implementation, and a promising outlook for increased performance in larger systems.

[2101.11733] Structures of bulk hexagonal post-transition-metal chalcogenides from dispersion-corrected density-functional theory	S. J. Magorrian V. Zólyomi N. D. Drummond	National Graphene Institute University of Manchester Booth Street East Manchester M13 9PL United Kingdom		We use dispersion-corrected density-functional theory to determine the relative energies of competing polytypes of bulk layered hexagonal post-transition-metal chalcogenides, to search for the most stable structures of these potentially technologically important semiconductors. We show that there is some degree of consensus among dispersion-corrected exchange-correlation functionals regarding the energetic orderings of polytypes, but we find that for each material there are multiple stacking orders with relative energies of less than 1 meV per monolayer unit cell, implying that stacking faults are expected to be abundant in all post-transition-metal chalcogenides. By fitting a simple model to all our energy data, we predict that the most stable hexagonal structure has P/mmc space group in each case, but that the stacking order differs between GaS, GaSe, GaTe, and InS on the one hand and InSe and InTe on the other. At zero pressure, the relative energies obtained with different functionals disagree by around 1–5 meV per monolayer unit cell, which is not sufficient to identify the most stable structure unambiguously; however, multi-GPa pressures reduce the number of competing phases significantly. At higher pressures, an AB-stacked structure of the most stable monolayer polytype is found to be the most stable bulk structure; this structure has not been reported in experiments thus far.

We consider a model device based on a two-dimensional photonic Harper-Hofstadter lattice including a broadband gain medium localized on the system edge. Different regimes are considered as a function of the value of the optical nonlinearity and of the gain relaxation time. The dispersion of the excitation modes is calculated via a full two-dimensional Bogoliubov approach and physically interpreted in terms of an effective one-dimensional theory. Depending on the system parameters, various possiblephysical processes leading todynamical instabilities are identifiedand characterized. On this basis, strategies to enforce a stable single-mode topological laser operation are finally pointed out.	
[2101.11738] Probabilistic Error Analysis For Sequential Summation of Real Floating Point NumbersFunding: This work was supported in part by National Science Foundation grant DMS-1760374.	Johnathan Rhyne	thanks:	ipsen@ncsu.edu jprhyne@ncsu.edu	We propose probabilistic models to bound the forward error in the numerically computed sum of a vector withreal elements. To do so, we generate our own deterministic bound for ease of comparison, and then create a model of our errors to generate probabilistic bounds of a comparable structure that can typically be computed alongside the actual computation of the sum.The errors are represented as bounded, independent, zero-mean random variables. We have found that our accuracy is increased when we use vectors that do not sum to zero. This accuracy reaches to be within 1 order of magnitude when all elements are of the same sign. We also show that our bounds are informative for most cases of IEEE half precision and all cases of single precision numbers for a for a vector of dimension,.Our numerical experiments confirm that the probabilistic bounds are tighter by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude than their deterministic counterparts for dimensions of at least 80 with extremely small failure probabilities. The experiments also confirm that our bounds are much more accurate for vectors consisting of elements of the same sign.	roundoff errors | random variables | sums of random variables | Martingales | forward error

We show that ILM does not lead to the same clear compositionality as observed using DCGs, but does lead to a modest improvement in compositionality, as measured by holdout accuracy and topologic similarity. We show that ILM can lead to an anti-correlation between holdout accuracy and topologic rho. We demonstrate that ILM can increase compositionality when using non-symbolic high-dimensional images as input.

Ciampa	Department of Physics & Astronomy Texas Christian University Fort Worth TX 76129 USA		Complex A is a high-velocity cloud that is traversing through the Galactic halo toward the Milky Way’s disk. We combine both new and archival Green Bank Telescope observations to construct a spectroscopically resolved Hi21-cm map of this entire complex at asensitivity for aline andorspatial resolution. We find that that Complex A is has a Galactic standard of rest frame velocity gradient ofalong its length, that it is decelerating at a rate of, and that it will reach the Galactic plane inif it can survive the journey. We have identify numerous signatures of gas disruption. The elongated and multi-core structure of Complex A indicates that either thermodynamic instabilities or shock-cascade processes have fragmented this stream. We find Rayleigh-Taylor fingers on the low-latitude edge of this HVC; many have been pushed backward by ram-pressure stripping. On the high-latitude side of the complex, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities have generated two large wings that extend tangentially off Complex A. The tips of these wings curve slightly forward in the direction of motion and have an elevated Hicolumn density, indicating that these wings are forming Rayleigh-Taylor globules at their tips and that this gas is becoming entangled with unseen vortices in the surrounding coronal gas. These observations provide new insights on the survivability of low-metallicity gas streams that are accreting ontogalaxies.

It consists of particle counters buriedunderground next to the water-Cherenkov stations that form thelarge infilled array. The reduced distance between detectors in this denser area allows the lowering of the energy threshold for primary cosmic ray reconstruction down to about. At the depth ofthe electromagnetic component of cosmic ray showers is almost entirely absorbed so that the buried scintillators provide an independent and direct measurement of the air showers muon content. This work describes the design and implementation of the AMIGA embedded system, which provides centralized control, data acquisition and environment monitoring to its detectors. The presented system was firstly tested in the engineering array phase ended in 2017, and lately selected as the final design to be installed in all new detectors of the production phase. The system was proven to be robust and reliable and has worked in a stable manner since its first deployment.

In this paper, we consider noisy binary neural networks, where each neuron has a non-zero probability of producing an incorrect output. These noisy models may arise from biological, physical and electronic contexts and constitute an important class of models that are relevant to the physical world. Intuitively, the number of neurons in such systems has to grow to compensate for the noise while maintaining the same level of expressive power and computation reliability. Our key finding is a lower bound for the required number of neurons in noisy neural networks, which is first of its kind. To prove this lower bound, we take an information theoretic approach and obtain a novel strong data processing inequality (SDPI), which not only generalizes the Evans-Schulman results for binary symmetric channels to general channels, but also improves the tightness drastically when applied to estimate end-to-end information contraction in networks. Our SDPI can be applied to various information processing systems, including neural networks and cellular automata. Applying the SDPI in noisy binary neural networks, we obtain our key lower bound and investigate its implications on network depth-width trade-offs, our results suggest a depth-width trade-off for noisy neural networks that is very different from the established understanding regarding noiseless neural networks. Furthermore, we apply the SDPI to study fault-tolerant cellular automata and obtain bounds on the error correction overheads and the relaxation time. This paper offers new understanding of noisy information processing systems through the lens of information theory.

[2101.11751] Faster Kernel Interpolation for Gaussian Processes	Mohit Yadav Daniel Sheldon Cameron MuscoUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst{ymohit, sheldon,			A key challenge in scaling Gaussian Process (GP) regression to massive datasets is that exact inference requires computation with a densekernel matrix, whereis the number of data points. Significant work focuses on approximating the kernel matrix via interpolation using a smaller set of“inducing points”.Structured kernel interpolation(SKI) is among the most scalable methods: by placing inducing points on a dense grid and using structured matrix algebra, SKI achieves per-iteration time offor approximate inference. This linear scaling inenables inference for very large data sets; however the cost isper-iteration, which remains a limitation for extremely large. We show that the SKI per-iteration time can be reduced toafter a singletime precomputation step by reframing SKI as solving a natural Bayesian linear regression problem with a fixed set ofcompact basis functions.With per-iteration complexityindependent of the dataset sizefor a fixed grid, our method scales to truly massive data sets. We demonstrate speedups in practice for a wide range ofandand apply the method to GP inference on a three-dimensional weather radar dataset with over 100 million points.Our code is available athttps://github.com/ymohit/fkigp.

[2101.11753] PROTODA: EFFICIENT TRANSFER LEARNING FOR FEW-SHOT INTENT CLASSIFICATION				Practical sequence classification tasks in natural language processing often suffer from low training data availability for target classes. Recent works towards mitigating this problem have focused on transfer learning using embeddings pre-trained on often unrelated tasks, for instance, language modeling. We adopt an alternative approach by transfer learning on an ensemble of related tasks using prototypical networks under the meta-learning paradigm. Using intent classification as a case study, we demonstrate that increasing variability in training tasks can significantly improve classification performance. Further, we apply data augmentation in conjunction with meta-learning to reduce sampling bias. We make use of a conditional generator for data augmentation that is trained directly using the meta-learning objective and simultaneously with prototypical networks, hence ensuring that data augmentation is customized to the task. We explore augmentation in the sentence embedding space as well as prototypical embedding space. Combining meta-learning with augmentation provides upto 6.49% and 8.53% relative F1-score improvements over the best performing systems in the 5-shot and 10-shot learning, respectively.

Mixon333Department of Mathematics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH444Translational Data Analytics Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH			We study tight projective-designs in three different settings. In the complex setting, Zauner’s conjecture predicts the existence of a tight projective-design in every dimension. Pandey, Paulsen, Prakash, and Rahaman recently proposed an approach to make quantitative progress on this conjecture in terms of the entanglement breaking rank of a certain quantum channel. We show that this quantity is equal to the size of the smallest weighted projective-design. Next, in the finite field setting, we introduce a notion of projective-designs, we characterize when such projective-designs are tight, and we provide a construction of such objects. Finally, in the quaternionic setting, we show that every tight projective-design fordetermines an equi-isoclinic tight fusion frame ofsubspaces ofof dimension.

[2101.11758] Detecting Hidden Layers from Spreading Dynamics on Complex Networks	Łukasz G. Gajewski Jan Chołoniewski Mateusz Wilinski		lukaszgajewski@tuta.io	When dealing with spreading processes on networks it can be of the utmost importance to test the reliability of data and identify potential unobserved spreading paths. In this paper we address these problems and propose methods for hidden layer identification and reconstruction. We also explore the interplay between difficulty of the task and the structure of the multilayer network describing the whole system where the spreading process occurs. Our methods stem from an exact expression for the likelihood of a cascade in the Susceptible-Infected model on an arbitrary graph. We then show that by imploring statistical properties of unimodal distributions and simple heuristics describing joint likelihood of a series of cascades one can obtain an estimate of both existence of a hidden layer and its content with success rates far exceeding those of a null model. We conduct our analyses on both synthetic and real-world networks providing evidence for the viability of the approach presented.

[2101.11761] Percolation on complex networks: Theory and application	Ming Li Run-Ran Liu Linyuan Lü Mao-Bin Hu Shuqi Xu Yi-Cheng Zhang		linyuan.lv@uestc.edu.cn	In the last two decades, network science has blossomed and influenced various fields, such as statistical physics, computer science, biology and sociology, from the perspective of the heterogeneous interaction patterns of components composing the complex systems. As a paradigm for random and semi-random connectivity, percolation model plays a key role in the development of network science and its applications. On the one hand, the concepts and analytical methods, such as the emergence of the giant cluster, the finite-size scaling, and the mean-field method, which are intimately related to the percolation theory, are employed to quantify and solve some core problems of networks. On the other hand, the insights into the percolation theory also facilitate the understanding of networked systems, such as robustness, epidemic spreading, vital node identification, and community detection. Meanwhile, network science also brings some new issues to the percolation theory itself, such as percolation of strong heterogeneous systems, topological transition of networks beyond pairwise interactions, and emergence of a giant cluster with mutual connections. So far, the percolation theory has already percolated into the researches of structure analysis and dynamic modeling in network science. Understanding the percolation theory should help the study of many fields in network science, including the still opening questions in the frontiers of networks, such as networks beyond pairwise interactions, temporal networks, and network of networks. The intention of this paper is to offer an overview of these applications, as well as the basic theory of percolation transition on network systems.

In these cases, classical models that provide good approximations to systems with infinitely long codewords become imprecise. To remedy this, in this paper, an average coding rate expression is derived for a large-scale network with short codewords using stochastic geometry and the theory of coding in the finite blocklength regime. The average coding rate and upper and lower bounds on the outage probability of the large-scale network are derived, and a tight approximation of the outage probability is presented. Then, simulations are presented to study the effect of network parameters on the average coding rate and the outage probability of the network, which demonstrate that results in the literature derived for the infinite blocklength regime overestimate the network performance, whereas the results in this paper provide a more realistic performance evaluation.

In this model, feature of the Hawking radiation is represented by three mode Bogoliubov transformation connecting the in-vacuum state and the out-state. We obtain the exact form of the tripartite in-vacuum state which encodes structure of multipartite entanglement. Bogoliubov coefficients are computed by numerical calculation of the wave equation with subluminal dispersion and it is found that genuine tripartite entanglement persists in whole frequency range up to the cutoff arisen from the subluminal dispersion. In the low frequency region, amount of the tripartite entanglement is far small compared to bipartite entanglement between the Hawking particle and its partner mode, and the deviation from the thermal spectrum is negligible. On the other hand, in the high frequency region near the cutoff, entanglement of the system is equally shared by two pairs of three modes, and the thermal nature of the Hawking radiation is lost.

Email: Address: NEC Laboratories America Inc. 4 Independence Way Suite 200 Princeton NJ 08540	kruus@nec-labs.com	Robustness against adversarial attack in neural networks is an important research topic in the machine learning community. We observe one major source of vulnerability of neural nets is from overparameterized fully-connected layers. In this paper, we propose a new neighborhood preserving layer which can replace these fully connected layers to improve the network robustness. We demonstrate a novel neural network architecture which can incorporate such layers and also can be trained efficiently. We theoretically prove that our models are more robust against distortion because they effectively control the magnitude of gradients. Finally, we empirically show that our designed network architecture is more robust against state-of-art gradient descent based attacks, such as a PGD attack on the benchmark datasets MNIST and CIFAR10.

McKeon	Aerospace Laboratories California Institute of Technology Pasadena CA 91125 USA	andrewt@caltech.edu jbae@caltech.edu arslan@caltech.edu mckeon@caltech.edu	The interaction between shear driven turbulence and stratification is a key process in a wide array of geophysical flows with spatio-temporal scales that span many orders of magnitude. A quick numerical model prediction based on external parameters of stratified boundary layers could greatly benefit the understanding of the interaction between velocity and scalar flux at varying scales. For these reasons, here, we use the resolvent framework[1]to investigate the effects of an active scalar on incompressible wall-bounded turbulence. We obtain the state of the flow system by applying the linear resolvent operator to the nonlinear terms in the governing Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation. This extends the formulation to include the scalar advection equation with the scalar component acting in the wall-normal direction in the momentum equations[2]. We use the mean velocity profiles from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a stably-stratified turbulent channel flow at varying friction Richardson number. The results obtained from the resolvent analysis are compared to the premultiplied energy spectra, auto-correlation coefficient, and the energy budget terms obtained from the DNS. It is shown that despite using only a very limited range of representative scales, the resolvent model is able to reproduce the balance of energy budget terms as well as provide meaningful insight of coherent structures occurring in the flow. Computation of the leading resolvent models, despite considering a limited range of scales, reproduces the balance of energy budget terms, provides meaningful predictions of coherent structures in the flow, and is more cost-effective than performing full-scale simulations. This quick model can provide further understanding of stratified flows with only information about the mean profile and prior knowledge of energetic scales of motion in the neutrally-buoyant boundary layers.

Consequently, many people feel a lack of agency over their app use, which is linked to negative life effects such as loss of sleep. Prior design research has innovatedexternal mechanismsthat police multiple apps, such as lockout timers. In this work, we shift the focus to how theinternal mechanismsof an app can support user agency, taking the popular YouTube mobile app as a test case. From a survey of 120 U.S. users, we find that autoplay and recommendations primarily undermine sense of agency, while search and playlists support it. From 13 co-design sessions, we find that when users have a specific intention for how they want to use YouTube they prefer interfaces that support greater agency. We discuss implications for how designers can help users reclaim a sense of agency over their media use.	digital wellbeing | sense of agency | social media | YouTube

Generalizing the Andrews-Yee identities for trivariate generalizations of these mock theta functions remained a mystery, as pointed out by Li and Yang in their recent work. We partially solve this problem and generalize these identities. Several new as well as well-known results are derived. For example, one of our two main theorems gives, as a corollary, a special case of Soon-Yi Kang’s three-variable reciprocity theorem. A relation between a new restricted overpartition functionand a weighted partition functionis obtained from one of the special cases of our second theorem.	Keywords and phrases.
[2101.11780] A characterization of constant 𝑝-mean curvature surfaces in the Heisenberg group 𝐻₁	Hung-Lin Chiu and Hsiao-Fan Liu	Department of Mathematics National Tsing Hua University Hsinchu Taiwan 300 of Mathematics TamKang University New Taipei City 25137 Taiwan 	hlchiu@math.nthu.edu.tw hfliu@mail.tku.edu.tw	In Euclidean-space, it is well known that the Sine-Gordon equation was considered in the nineteenth century in the course of investigations of surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature. Such a surface can be constructed from a solution to the Sine-Gordon equation, and vice versa. With this as motivation, employing the fundamental theorem of surfaces in the Heisenberg group, we show in this paper that the existence of a constant-mean curvature surface (without singular points) is equivalent to the existence of a solution to a nonlinear second-order ODE (1.2), which is a kind ofLiénard equations. Therefore, we turn to investigate this equation. It is a surprise that we give a complete set of solutions to (1.2) (or (1.5)), and hence use the types of the solution to divide constant-mean curvature surfaces into several classes. As a result, after a kind of normalization, we obtain a representation of constant-mean curvature surfaces and classify further all constant-mean curvature surfaces. In Section9, we provide an approach to construct-minimal surfaces. It turns out that, in some sense, generic-minimal surfaces can be constructed via this approach. Finally, as a derivation, we recover the Bernstein-type theorem which was first shown in[3](or see[7,8]).	Heisenberg group | Pansu sphere | p-Minimal surface | Liénard equation | Bernstein theorem
[2101.11781] Hamilton-Jacobi approach for linearly acceleration-dependent Lagrangians	Alejandro Aguilar-Salas Efraín Rojas	de Matemáticas Universidad Veracruzana Cto. Gonzálo Aguirre Beltrán s/n Xalapa Veracruz 91000 México	efrojas@uv.mx alejanaguilar@uv.mx	We develop a constructive procedure for arriving at the Hamilton-Jacobi framework for the so-called affine in acceleration theories by analysing the canonical constraint structure. We find two scenarios in dependence of the order of the emerging equations of motion. By properly defining generalized brackets, the non-involutive constraints that originally arose, in both scenarios, may be removed so that the resulting involutive Hamiltonian constraints ensure integrability of the theories and, at the same time, lead to the right dynamics in the reduced phase space. In particular, when we have second-order in derivatives equations of motion we are able to detect the gauge invariant sector of the theory by using a suitable approach based on the projection of the Hamiltonians onto the tangential and normal directions of the congruence of curves in the configuration space. Regarding this, we also explore the generators of canonical and gauge transformations of these theories. Further, we briefly outline how to determine the Hamilton principal functionfor some particular setups. We apply our findings to some representative theories: a Chern-Simons-like theory in-dim, an harmonic oscillator inand, the geodetic brane cosmology emerging in the context of extra dimensions.	pacs:02.30.Jr | 04.20.Fy | 11.10.Ef
[2101.11782] Object Detection Made Simpler by Eliminating Heuristic NMS	Qiang Zhou, Chaohui Yu, Chunhua Shen, Zhibin Wang, Hao LiAlibaba GroupMonash University; The University of Adelaide	footnotetext:		We show a simple NMS-free, end-to-end object detection framework, of which the network is a minimal modification to a one-stage object detector such as the FCOS detection model[24]. We attain on par or even improved detection accuracy compared with the original one-stage detector. It performs detection at almost the same inference speed, while being even simpler in that now the post-processing NMS (non-maximum suppression) is eliminated during inference. If the network is capable of identifying only one positive sample for prediction for each ground-truth object instance in an image, then NMS would become unnecessary. This is made possible by attaching a compact PSS head for automatic selection of the single positive sample for each instance (see Fig.LABEL:fig:model). As the learning objective involves both one-to-many and one-to-one label assignments, there is a conflict in the labels of some training examples, making the learning challenging. We show that by employing a stop-gradient operation, we can successfully tackle this issue and train the detector.

[2101.11784] Oceanic Superrotation on Tidally Locked Planets	Yaoxuan Zeng Jun Yang	Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences School of Physics Peking University Beijing 100871 China.		Is there oceanic superrotation on exoplanets? Atmospheric superrotation, characterized by west-to-east winds over the equator, is a common phenomenon in the atmospheres of Venus, Titan, Saturn, Jupiter, and tidally locked exoplanets. The stratospheric atmosphere of Earth is also superrotating during the westerly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). However, whether the same phenomenon can occur in ocean is poorly known. Through numerical simulations, here we show that oceanic superrotation does occur on tidally locked terrestrial planets around low-mass stars. Its formation (spun-up from rest) is associated with surface winds, the equatorward momentum convergence by Rossby waves, and the eastward propagation of Kelvin waves in the ocean. Its maintenance is driven by equatorward momentum transports of coupled Rossby-Kelvin waves in the ocean excited from the uneven stellar radiation distribution. The width of the superrotation is mainly constrained by the Rossby deformation radius in the ocean, while its strength is more complex. Many factors can influence the strength, including planetary rotation rate, stellar flux, greenhouse gas concentration, seawater salinity, bottom drag, and a scaling theory is lack. This work confirms that superrotation can occur on tidally locked terrestrial planets with seawater oceans and suggests that it may also occur on tidally locked hot planets with magma oceans that will possibly be observed in the near future.

In this context, preserving high Quality of Service (QoS) and maintaining low latency communication are of paramount importance. In cellular networks, incorporation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can result in enhanced connectivity for outdoor users due to the high probability of establishing Line of Sight (LoS) links. The UAV’s limited battery life and its signal attenuation in indoor areas, however, make it inefficient to manage users’ requests in indoor environments. Referred to as the Cluster-centric and Coded UAV-aided Femtocaching (CCUF) framework, the network’s coverage in both indoor and outdoor environments increases by considering a two-phase clustering framework for FAPs’ formation and UAVs’ deployment. Our first objective is to increase the content diversity. In this context, we propose a coded content placement in a cluster-centric cellular network, which is integrated with the Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) approach to mitigate the inter-cell interference in edge areas. Then, we compute, experimentally, the number of coded contents to be stored in each caching node to increase the cache-hit-ratio, Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), and cache diversity and decrease the users’ access delay and cache redundancy for different content popularity profiles. Capitalizing on clustering, our second objective is to assign the best caching node to indoor/outdoor users for managing their requests. In this regard, we define the movement speed of ground users as the decision metric of the transmission scheme for serving outdoor users’ requests to avoid frequent handovers between FAPs and increase the battery life of UAVs. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed CCUF implementation increases the cache-hit-ratio, SINR, and cache diversity and decrease the users’ access delay, cache redundancy and UAVs’ energy consumption.

[2101.11788] Spectral Functions from Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo without Analytic Continuation: The Extended Koopmans’ Theorem Approach	Joonho Lee Fionn D. Malone Miguel A. Morales David R. Reichman	of Chemistry Columbia University New York NY 10027 USA.	jl5653@columbia.edu fionn.malone@gmail.com drr2103@columbia.edu moralessilva2@llnl.gov	We explore the extended Koopmans’ theorem (EKT) within the phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method. The EKT allows for the direct calculation of electron addition and removal spectral functions using reduced density matrices of the-particle system, and avoids the need for analytic continuation. The lowest level of EKT with AFQMC, called EKT1-AFQMC, is benchmarked using small molecules, 14-electron and 54-electron uniform electron gas supercells, and diamond at the-point. Via comparison with numerically exact results (when possible) and coupled-cluster methods, we find that EKT1-AFQMC can reproduce the qualitative features of spectral functions for Koopmans-like charge excitations with errors in peak locations of less than 0.25 eV in a finite basis. We also note the numerical difficulties that arise in the EKT1-AFQMC eigenvalue problem, especially when back-propagated quantities are very noisy. We show how a systematic higher order EKT approach can correct errors in EKT1-based theories with respect to the satellite region of the spectral function. Our work will be of use for the study of low-energy charge excitations and spectral functions in correlated molecules and solids where AFQMC can be reliably performed.	
[2101.11789] Augmenting Proposals by the Detector Itself	Xiaopei Wan Zhenhua Guo Chao He Yujiu Yang Fangbo TaoTsinghua UniversityAlibaba Group{wxp18,   {mianzhang.gzh,		yang.yujiu@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn	Lacking enough high quality proposals for RoI box head has impeded two-stage and multi-stage object detectors for a long time, and many previous works try to solve it via improving RPN’s performance or manually generating proposals from ground truth. However, these methods either need huge training and inference costs or bring little improvements. In this paper, we design a novel training method named APDI, which means augmenting proposals by the detector itself and can generate proposals with higher quality. Furthermore, APDI makes it possible to integrate IoU head into RoI box head. And it does not add any hyper-parameter, which is beneficial for future research and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on COCO dataset show that our method brings at least 2.7 AP improvements on Faster R-CNN with various backbones, and APDI can cooperate with advanced RPNs, such as GA-RPN and Cascade RPN, to obtain extra gains. Furthermore, it brings significant improvements on Cascade R-CNN.111All source codes will be released after publication.

Can machines learn to emulate this laborious process? We present a novel task and approach for document-to-slide generation. Solving this involves document summarization, image and text retrieval, and slide structure to arrange key elements in a form suitable for presentation. We propose a hierarchical sequence-to-sequence approach to tackle our task in an end-to-end manner. Our approach exploits the inherent structures within documents and slides and incorporates paraphrasing and layout prediction modules to generate slides. To help accelerate research in this domain, we release a dataset of about 6K paired documents and slide decks used in our experiments. We show that our approach outperforms strong baselines and produces slides with rich content and aligned imagery.††Project webpage: https://doc2ppt.github.io/

Field Gaurav Khanna Mark A. Scheel Harald P. Pfeiffer Davide Gerosa Lawrence E. Kidder	thanks:	tislam@umassd.edu	We develop new strategies to build numerical relativity surrogate models for eccentric binary black hole systems, which are expected to play an increasingly important role in current and future gravitational-wave detectors. We introduce a new surrogate waveform model,NRSur2dq1Ecc, using 47 nonspinning, equal-mass waveforms with eccentricities up towhen measured at a reference time ofbefore merger. This is the first waveform model that is directly trained on eccentric numerical relativity simulations and does not require that the binary circularizes before merger. The model includes the,, andspin-weighted spherical harmonic modes. We also build a final black hole model,NRSur2dq1EccRemnant, which models the mass, and spin of the remnant black hole. We show that our waveform model can accurately predict numerical relativity waveforms with mismatches, while the remnant model can recover the final mass and dimensionless spin with absolute errors smaller thanandrespectively. We demonstrate that the waveform model can also recover subtle effects like mode-mixing in the ringdown signal without any special ad-hoc modeling steps. Finally, we show that despite being trained only on equal-mass binaries,NRSur2dq1Ecccan be reasonably extended up to mass ratiowith mismatchesfor eccentricities smaller thanas measured at a reference time ofbefore merger. The methods developed here should prove useful in the building of future eccentric surrogate models over larger regions of the parameter space.

An attacker in FL may control a number of participant clients, and purposely craft the uploaded model parameters to manipulate system outputs, namely, model poisoning (MP). In this paper, we aim to propose effective MP algorithms to combat state-of-the-art defensive aggregation mechanisms (e.g., Krum and Trimmed mean) implemented at the server without being noticed, i.e., covert MP (CMP). Specifically, we first formulate the MP as an optimization problem by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the manipulated model and designated one, constrained by a defensive aggregation rule. Then, we develop CMP algorithms against different defensive mechanisms based on the solutions of their corresponding optimization problems. Furthermore, to reduce the optimization complexity, we propose low complexity CMP algorithms with a slight performance degradation. In the case that the attacker does not know the defensive aggregation mechanism, we design a blind CMP algorithm, in which the manipulated model will be adjusted properly according to the aggregated model generated by the unknown defensive aggregation. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CMP algorithms are effective and substantially outperform existing attack mechanisms.

[2101.11800] AdaSpring: Context-adaptive and Runtime-evolutionary Deep Model Compression for Mobile Applications	Sicong Liu Bin Guo Ke Ma Zhiwen Yu Junzhao Du	Northwestern Polytechnical UniversitySchool of Computer ScienceXi’anChina	guob@nwpu.edu.cn	There are many deep learning (e.g.DNN) powered mobile and wearable applications today continuously and unobtrusively sensing the ambient surroundings to enhance all aspects of human lives. To enable robust and private mobile sensing, DNN tends to be deployed locally on the resource-constrained mobile devices via model compression. The current practice either hand-crafted DNN compression techniques,i.e., for optimizing DNN-relative performance (e.g.parameter size), or on-demand DNN compression methods,i.e., for optimizing hardware-dependent metrics (e.g.latency), cannot be locally online because they require offline retraining to ensure accuracy. Also, none of them have correlated their efforts with runtime adaptive compression to consider the dynamic nature of deployment context of mobile applications. To address those challenges, we present AdaSpring, a context-adaptive and self-evolutionary DNN compression framework. It enables the runtime adaptive DNN compression locally online. Specifically, it presents the ensemble training of a retraining-free and self-evolutionary network to integrate multiple alternative DNN compression configurations (i.e., compressed architectures and weights). It then introduces the runtime search strategy to quickly search for the most suitable compression configurations and evolve the corresponding weights. With evaluation on five tasks across three platforms and a real-world case study, experiment outcomes show that AdaSpring obtains up tolatency reduction,energy efficiency improvement in DNNs, compared to hand-crafted compression techniques, while only incurringruntime-evolution latency.

An interesting phenomenon associated with this process is the self-induced explosion of the drop, producing a multitude of smaller secondary droplets, which promotes overall fuel atomization and, consequently, improves the combustion efficiency and reduces emissions of liquid-fueled engines. Here, we study a unique explosive gasification process of a tri-component droplet consisting of water, ethanol, and oil (“ouzo”), by high-speed monitoring of the entire gasification event taking place in the well-controlled, levitated Leidenfrost state over a superheated plate. It is observed that the preferential evaporation of the most volatile component, ethanol, triggers nucleation of the oil microdroplets/nanodroplets in the remaining drop, which, consequently, becomes an opaque oil-in-water microemulsion. The tiny oil droplets subsequently coalesce into a large one, which, in turn, wraps around the remnant water. Because of the encapsulating oil layer, the droplet can no longer produce enough vapor for its levitation, and, thus, falls and contacts the superheated surface. The direct thermal contact leads to vapor bubble formation inside the drop and consequently drop explosion in the final stage.	multicomponent dropLeidenfrost stateinternal interactionvolatility differentialsmutual solubility differentials
[2101.11802] Weakly Supervised Neuro-Symbolic Module Networks for Numerical Reasoning	Amrita Saha Shafiq Joty Steven C.H. Hoi	Salesforce AI Research		Neural Module Networks (NMNs) have been quite successful in incorporating explicit reasoning as learnable modules in various question answering tasks, including the most generic form of numerical reasoning over text in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). However, to achieve this, contemporary NMNs need strong supervision in executing the query as a specialized program over reasoning modules and fail to generalize to more open-ended settings without such supervision. Hence we proposeWeakly-SupervisedNeuro-SymbolicModuleNetwork (WNSMN) trained with answers as the sole supervision for numerical reasoning based MRC. It learns to execute a noisy heuristic program obtained from the dependency parsing of the query, as discrete actions over both neural and symbolic reasoning modules and trains it end-to-end in a reinforcement learning framework with discrete reward from answer matching. On the numerical-answer subset of DROP, WNSMN outperforms NMN by 32% and the reasoning-free language model GenBERT by 8% in exact match accuracy when trained under comparable weak supervised settings. This showcases the effectiveness and generalizability of modular networks that can handle explicit discrete reasoning over noisy programs in an end-to-end manner.

This technique, in combination with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), often provides an opportunity to observe unexpected phenomena. However, the amount of transferred charge and the corresponding change in the electronic structure vary significantly depending on the material. Here, we report study on the correlation between the sample work function and alkali metal induced electronic structure change for three iron-based superconductors: FeSe, Ba(FeCo)Asand NaFeAs which share a similar Fermi surface topology. Electronic structure change upon monolayer of alkali metal dosing and the sample work function were measured by ARPES. Our results show that the degree of electronic structure change is proportional to the difference between the work function of the sample and Mulliken’s absolute electronegativity of the dosed alkali metal. This finding provides a possible way to estimate the AMD induced electronic structure change.	Work function | Alkali metal dosing | ARPES | Iron-based superconductors | Electronic structure

[2101.11807] A Kernel-Based Neural Network for High-dimensional Genetic Risk Prediction Analysis	Xiaoxi Shen Xiaoran Tong andQing Lu			Risk prediction capitalizing on emerging human genome findings holds great promise for new prediction and prevention strategies. While the large amounts of genetic data generated from high-throughput technologies offer us a unique opportunity to study a deep catalog of genetic variants for risk prediction, the high-dimensionality of genetic data and complex relationships between genetic variants and disease outcomes bring tremendous challenges to risk prediction analysis. To address these rising challenges, we propose a kernel-based neural network (KNN) method. KNN inherits features from both linear mixed models (LMM) and classical neural networks and is designed for high-dimensional risk prediction analysis. To deal with datasets with millions of variants, KNN summarizes genetic data into kernel matrices and use the kernel matrices as inputs. Based on the kernel matrices, KNN builds a single-layer feedforward neural network, which makes it feasible to consider complex relationships between genetic variants and disease outcomes. The parameter estimation in KNN is based on MINQUE and we show, that under certain conditions, the average prediction error of KNN can be smaller than that of LMM. Simulation studies also confirm the results.

Reina		ffebres@hep.fsu.edu reina@hep.fsu.edu mkraus@hep.fsu.edu	We present a new Monte Carlo event generator for the production of a top-quark pair in association with aboson at hadron colliders in thePOWHEG-BOXframework. We consider the next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to thecross section, corresponding to theandterms in the perturbative expansion of the parton-level cross section, and model the decays ofand top quarks at leading order retaining spin correlations. The fixed-order QCD calculation is further interfaced with thePYTHIA8parton-shower event generator via the POWHEG method as implemented in thePOWHEG-BOX. The corresponding code is now part of the public repository of thePOWHEG-BOX. We perform a comparison of different event generators for both the case of inclusive production and the case of the two same-sign leptons signature at the Large Hadron Collider operating at a center-of-mass energy of. We investigate theoretical uncertainties in the modelling of the fiducial volume stemming from missing higher-order corrections, the different parton shower matching schemes, and the modelling of decays. We find that the subleading contribution atis particularly sensitive to differences in the matching scheme and higher-order parton shower effects. We observe that in particular jet observables can differ quite visibly although these differences play only a subordinate role in the description of physical observables once all contributions are combined.

Towards this goal, we present here a non-intrusive model reduction framework using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and neural networks, based on the usual offline-online paradigm. As the conductivity of porous media can be highly heterogeneous and span several orders of magnitude, we utilize the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method as a full order solver to handle discontinuity and ensure local mass conservation during the offline stage. We then use POD as a data compression tool and compare the nested POD technique, in which time and uncertain parameter domains are compressed consecutively, to the classical POD method in which all domains are compressed simultaneously. The neural networks are finally trained to map the set of uncertain parameters, which could correspond to material properties, boundary conditions, or geometric characteristics, to the collection of coefficients calculated from anprojection over the reduced basis. We then perform a non-intrusive evaluation of the neural networks to obtain coefficients corresponding to new values of the uncertain parameters during the online stage. We show that our framework provides reasonable approximations of the DG solution, but it is significantly faster. Moreover, the reduced order framework can capture sharp discontinuities of both displacement and pressure fields resulting from the heterogeneity in the media conductivity, which is generally challenging for intrusive reduced order methods. The sources of error are presented, showing that the nested POD technique is computationally advantageous and still provides comparable accuracy to the classical POD method. We also explore the effect of different choices of the hyperparameters of the neural network on the framework performance.	
[2101.11811] Effect of rate of change of parameter on early warning signals for critical transitions	Induja Pavithran R. I. Sujith	Department of Physics IIT Madras Chennai-600036 India	sujith@iitm.ac.in	Many dynamical systems exhibit abrupt transitions or tipping as the control parameter is varied. In scenarios where the parameter is varied continuously, the rate of change of control parametergreatly affects the performance of early warning signals (EWS) for such critical transitions.We study the impact of variation of the control parameter with a finite rate on the performance ofEWS for critical transitionsin a thermoacoustic system (a horizontal Rijke tube) exhibiting subcritical Hopf bifurcation. There is a growing interest in developing early warning signals for tipping in real systems. Firstly, we explore the efficacy of early warning signals based on critical slowing down and fractalcharacteristics. From this study, lag-1 autocorrelation (AC) and Hurst exponent () are found to be good measures topredict the transitionwell-before the tipping point. The warning time, obtained using AC and, reduces with an increase in the rate of change of the control parameter following an inverse power law relation. Hence, for very fast rates, the warning time may be too short to perform any control action. Furthermore, we report the observation of a hyperexponential scaling relation between the AC and the variance of fluctuations during such dynamic Hopf bifurcation. We construct a theoretical model for noisy Hopf bifurcation wherein the control parameter is continuously variedat different rates to study the effect of rate of change of parameter on EWS. Similar results, including the hyperexponential scaling, are observed in the model as well.

One such task is manipulating objects by using gravity or arm accelerations, increasing the importance of mass, center of mass, and friction information. We present SwingBot, a robot that is able to learn the physical features of a held object through tactile exploration. Two exploration actions (tilting and shaking) provide the tactile information used to create a physical feature embedding space. With this embedding, SwingBot is able to predict the swing angle achieved by a robot performing dynamic swing-up manipulations on a previously unseen object. Using these predictions, it is able to search for the optimal control parameters for a desired swing-up angle. We show that with the learned physical features our end-to-end self-supervised learning pipeline is able to substantially improve the accuracy of swinging up unseen objects. We also show that objects with similar dynamics are closer to each other on the embedding space and that the embedding can be disentangled into values of specific physical properties.

Tiao Fellowship and the William S. Fishman Research Fund.University of Chicago	tengyuan.liang@chicagobooth.edu brecht@berkeley.edu	This paper provides elementary analyses of the regret and generalization of minimum-norm interpolating classifiers (MNIC). The MNIC is the function of smallest Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space norm that perfectly interpolates a label pattern on a finite data set. We derive a mistake bound for MNIC and a regularized variant that holds for all data sets. This bound follows from elementary properties of matrix inverses. Under the assumption that the data is independently and identically distributed, the mistake bound implies that MNIC generalizes at a rate proportional to the norm of the interpolating solution and inversely proportional to the number of data points. This rate matches similar rates derived for margin classifiers and perceptrons. We derive several plausible generative models where the norm of the interpolating classifier is bounded or grows at a rate sublinear in. We also show that as long as the population class conditional distributions are sufficiently separable in total variation, then MNIC generalizes with a fast rate.	
[2101.11816] Inference of stochastic time series with missing data	Sangwon Lee Vipul Periwal Junghyo Jo	Department of Physics and Astronomy Seoul National University Seoul 08826 Korea	vipulp@mail.nih.gov jojunghyo@snu.ac.kr	Inferring dynamics from time series is an important objective in data analysis. In particular, it is challenging to infer stochastic dynamics given incomplete data. We propose an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that iterates between alternating two steps: E-step restores missing data points, while M-step infers an underlying network model from the restored data. Using synthetic data of a kinetic Ising model, we confirm that the algorithm works for restoring missing data points as well as inferring the underlying model. At the initial iteration of the EM algorithm, the model inference shows better model-data consistency with observed data points than with missing data points. As we keep iterating, however, missing data points show better model-data consistency. We find that demanding equal consistency of observed and missing data points provides an effective stopping criterion for the iteration to prevent going beyond the most accurate model inference.Using the EM algorithm and the stopping criterion together, we infer missing data points from a time-series data of real neuronal activities.Our method reproduces collective properties of neuronal activities such as correlations and firing statistics even when 70% of data points are masked as missing points.

Drew and Sean Follmer are with the Department of Mechanical Engineering Stanford University Stanford CA Devlin and Elliot Hawkes are with the Department of Mechanical Engineering University of California Santa Barbara Santa Barbara CA USA.	dsdrew@stanford.edu	Modular soft robots combine the strengths of two traditionally separate areas of robotics. As modular robots, they can show robustness to individual failure and reconfigurability; as soft robots, they can deform and undergo large shape changes in order to adapt to their environment, and have inherent human safety. However, for sensing and communication these robots also combine the challenges of both: they require solutions that are scalable (low cost and complexity) and efficient (low power) to enable collectives of large numbers of robots, and these solutions must also be able to interface with the high extension ratio elastic bodies of soft robots. In this work, we seek to address these challenges using acoustic signals produced by piezoelectric surface transducers that are cheap, simple, and low power, and that not only integrate with but also leverage the elastic robot skins for signal transmission. Importantly, to further increase scalability, the transducers exhibit multi-functionality made possible by a relatively flat frequency response across the audible and ultrasonic ranges. With minimal hardware, they enable directional contact-based communication, audible-range communication at a distance, and exteroceptive sensing. We demonstrate a subset of the decentralized collective behaviors these functions make possible with multi-robot hardware implementations. The use of acoustic waves in this domain is shown to provide distinct advantages over existing solutions.

In this work, we present the first ever detailed abundance analysis of carbon star LAMOSTJ091608.81+230734.6 and a detailed abundance analysis of neutron-capture elements for the object LAMOSTJ151003.74+305407.3. Updates on the abundances of elements C, O, Mg, Ca, Cr, Mn and Ni for LAMOSTJ151003.74+305407.3 are also presented. Our analysis is based on high resolution spectra obtained using Hanle Echelle Spectrograph (HESP) attached to the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), IAO, Hanle. The stellar atmospheric parameters (T, logg, micro-turbulance, metallicity [Fe/H]) are found to be (4820, 1.43, 1.62,0.89) and (4500, 1.55, 1.24,1.57) for these two objects respectively. The abundance estimates of several elements, C, N, O, Na,-elements, Fe-peak elements and neutron-capture elements Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm and Eu are presented. Our analysis shows the star LAMOSTJ151003.74+305407.3 to be a CEMP-r/s star, and LAMOSTJ091608.81+230734.6 a CH giant. We have examined if the i-process model yields ([X/Fe]) of heavy elements could explain the observed abundances of the CEMP-r/s star based on a parametric model based analysis. The negative values obtained for the neutron density dependent [Rb/Zr] ratio confirm former low-mass AGB companions for both the stars. Kinematic analysis shows that LAMOSTJ151003.74+305407.3 belongs to the Galactic halo population and LAMOSTJ091608.81+230734.6 to the disc population.	stars:individual - stars: Carbon - stars: Abundances - stars: nucleosynthesis

The Legendre wavelets series with unknown coefficients have been used for approximating the solution in both of the spatial and temporal variables. The basic idea for discretizing two-dimensional HTE is based on differentiation and integration of operational matrices. By implementing LWOMM on HTE, HTE is transformed into algebraic generalized Sylvester equation. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the presented numerical scheme. Comparisons of numerical results associated with the proposed method with some of the existing numerical methods confirm that the method is easy, accurate and fast experimentally. Moreover, we have investigated the convergence analysis of multidimensional Legendre wavelet approximation. Finally we have compared our result with research article of Mittal and Bhatia (seemittal_2014).

Using the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group, we calculateandcoefficients of the isobaric multiplet mass equation, starting from two different Hamiltonians constructed from chiral effective field theory. We compare results to experimental measurements for allisobaric analogue triplets of relevance to superallowed-decay for massestoand find an overall agreement within approximately 250 keV of experimental data for bothandcoefficients. A greater level of accuracy, however, is obtained by a phenomenological Skyrme interaction or a classical charged-sphere estimate. Finally, we show that evolution of the valence-space operator does not meaningfully improve the quality of the coefficients with respect to experimental data, which indicates that higher-order many-body effects are likely not responsible for the observed discrepancies.	
[2101.11827] Quantum Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem Far From Equilibrium	Zhedong Zhang Xuanhua Wang Jin Wang	thanks:	zzhan26@cityu.edu.hk jin.wang.1@stonybrook.edu	Fluctuations associated with relaxations in far-from-equilibrium regime is of fundamental interest for a large variety of systems within broad scales. Recent advances in techniques such as spectroscopy have generated the possibility for measuring the fluctuations of the mesoscopic systems in connection to the relaxation processes when driving the underlying quantum systems far from equilibrium. We present a general nonequilibrium Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) for quantum Markovian processes where the detailed-balance condition is violated. Apart from the fluctuations, the relaxation involves extra correlation that is governed by the quantum curl flux emerged in the far-from-equilibrium regime. Such a contribution vanishes for the thermal equilibrium, so that the conventional FDT is recovered. We finally apply the nonequilibrium FDT to the molecular junctions, elaborating the detailed-balance-breaking effects on the optical transmission spectrum. Our results have the advantage of and exceed the scope of the fluctuation-dissipation relation in the perturbative and near equilibrium regimes, and is of broad interest for the study of quantum thermodynamics.

Based on our two novel theorems, we introduce a new splitting strategy called iSAT, which allows ADF to classify new records even if they are associated with previously unseen classes. ADF is capable of identifying and handling concept drift; it, however, does not forget previously gained knowledge. Moreover, ADF is capable of handling big data if the data can be divided into batches. We evaluate ADF on five publicly available natural data sets and one synthetic data set, and compare the performance of ADF against the performance of eight state-of-the-art techniques. Our experimental results, including statistical sign test and Nemenyi test analyses, indicate a clear superiority of the proposed framework over the state-of-the-art techniques.

The importance of this ratio for charm and beauty pair production is examined according to the Hadron Electron Ring Accelerator (HERA) data. The behavior of these ratios considers due to the hard-pomeron behavior of the gluon distribution function. The results are in good agreement with respect to the HERA data. Expanding this data to the range of new energies underscore the importance of these measurements for heavy quarks. The ratio of charm and beauty structure functions at the proposed Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) is considered as a function of invariant center-of-mass energy. For top pair production this ratio is extracted with known kinematics of the LHeC and Future Circular Collider electron-hadron (FCC-eh) colliders. Comparison of the results obtained for the ratio of top structure functions in LHeC and FCC-eh are proportional to the specified inelasticityrange.	****

Because interstellar minor bodies are moving much faster, they hit planets harder and more often than in the local Galaxy. I estimate the rates for Chicxulub-scale impacts on an Earth-size planet in elliptical galaxies as a potential habitability constraint on intelligent life. Around most stars in a normal elliptical galaxy, these planets receive only, although hazardous rates may be common in certain compact early-type galaxies and red nuggets. Aboutof the stellar mass is in a region where the rate is, large enough to dominate the mass extinction rate. This suggests that elliptical galaxies have an exclusion zone of order one hundred parsecs in radius around their centers for the evolution of intelligent life.

This work is supported by The National Key Research and Development Program of China  and Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence .Jian SunMEGVII			In this paper, we investigate a new variant of neural architecture search (NAS) paradigm – searching with random labels (RLNAS). The task sounds counter-intuitive for most existing NAS algorithms since random label provides few information on the performance of each candidate architecture. Instead, we propose a novel NAS framework based on ease-of-convergence hypothesis, which requires only random labels during searching. The algorithm involves two steps: first, we train a SuperNet using random labels; second, from the SuperNet we extract the sub-network whose weights change most significantly during the training. Extensive experiments are evaluated on multiple datasets (e.g. NAS-Bench-201 and ImageNet) and multiple search spaces (e.g. DARTS-like and MobileNet-like). Very surprisingly, RLNAS achieves comparable or even better results compared with state-of-the-art NAS methods such as PC-DARTS, Single Path One-Shot, even though the counterparts utilize full ground truth labels for searching. We hope our finding could inspire new understandings on the essential of NAS. Code is available athttps://github.com/megvii-model/RLNAS.	
[2101.11835] Reducing ReLU Count for Privacy-Preserving CNN Speedup	Inbar Helbitz,1Shai Avidan2			Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning algorithms must balance classification accuracy with data privacy. This can be done using a combination of cryptographic and machine learning tools such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNNs typically consist of two types of operations: a convolutional or linear layer, followed by a non-linear function such as ReLU. Each of these types can be implemented efficiently using a different cryptographic tool. But these tools require different representations and switching between them is time-consuming and expensive. Recent research suggests that ReLU is responsible for most of the communication bandwidth.	
[2101.11836] DRAG: Director-Generator Language Modelling Framework for Non-Parallel Author Stylized Rewriting	Hrituraj SinghAdobe  VermaGeorgia  GarimellaAdobe  Vasan SrinivasanAdobe	This was work was carried out when the author was at Adobe Research.	garimell@adobe.com hrisingh@adobe.com gverma@gatech.edu balsrini@adobe.com	Author stylized rewriting is the task of rewriting an input text in a particular author’s style. Recent works in this area have leveraged Transformer-based language models in a denoising autoencoder setup to generate author stylized text without relying on a parallel corpus of data. However, these approaches are limited by the lack of explicit control of target attributes and being entirely data-driven. In this paper, we propose a Director-Generator framework to rewrite content in the target author’s style, specifically focusing on certain target attributes. We show that our proposed framework works well even with a limited-sized target author corpus. Our experiments on corpora consisting of relatively small-sized text authored by three distinct authors show significant improvements upon existing works to rewrite input texts in target author’s style. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses further show that our model has better meaning retention and results in more fluent generations.

This specification is necessary to apply the quantum measurement theory to gravitational-wave detections. We clarify the contribution of vacuum fluctuations to the noise spectral density without using the two-photon formulation. We found that the noise spectral density in the two-photon formulation includes vacuum fluctuations from the main interferometer but does not includes those from the local oscillator which depends on the directly measured operators.	quantum measurement theory | vacuum fluctuations | balanced homodyne detection | gravitational-wave detectors

[2101.11840] A holistic approach to computing first-arrival traveltimes using neural networks	Umair bin Waheed Tariq Alkhalifah Ehsan Haghighat Chao Song	of Geosciences King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals Dhahran 31261 Saudi Arabia.	umair.waheed@kfupm.edu.sa	Since the original algorithm by John Vidale in 1988 to numerically solve the isotropic eikonal equation, there has been tremendous progress on the topic addressing an array of challenges, including improvement of the solution accuracy, incorporation of surface topography, adding more accurate physics by accounting for anisotropy/attenuation in the medium, and speeding up computations using multiple CPUs and GPUs. Despite these advances, there is no mechanism in these algorithms to carry information gained by solving one problem to the next. Moreover, these approaches may breakdown for certain complex forms of the eikonal equation, requiringsimplification of the equations to estimate approximate solutions. Therefore, we seek an alternate approach to address the challenge in a holistic manner, i.e., a method that not only makes it simpler to incorporate topography, allows accounting for any level of complexity in physics, benefiting from computational speedup due to the availability of multiple CPUs or GPUs, but also able to transfer knowledge gained from solving one problem to the next. We develop an algorithm based on the emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural network to solve various forms of the eikonal equation. We show how transfer learning and surrogate modeling can be used to speed up computations by utilizing information gained from prior solutions. We also propose a two-stage optimization scheme to expedite the training process in the presence of sharper heterogeneity in the velocity model and recommend using a locally adaptive activation function for faster convergence. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the proposed approach makes it simpler to incorporate additional physics and other features in contrast to conventional methods that took years and often decades to make these advances. Such an approach not only makes the implementation of eikonal solvers much simpler but also puts us on a much faster path to progress. The method paves the pathway to solving complex forms of the eikonal equation that have remained unsolved using conventional algorithms or solved using some approximation techniques at best; thereby, creating new possibilities for advancement in the field of numerical eikonal solvers.

In this paper, we further consider the diffeomorphism classes of the resulting Calabi-Yau threefolds (which are called thedoubling Calabi-Yau threefolds) starting from different pairs of Fano threefolds with Picard number one. Using the classifications of simply-connected-manifolds in differential topology and the-invariantintroduced by Lee[Le20], we prove that any two of the doubling Calabi-Yau threefolds with Picard number two are not diffeomorphic to each other when the underlying Fano threefolds are distinct families.

These might be related to(i)the need to deal with projections onto high dimensional linear approximating trial manifolds,(ii)expensive hyper-reduction strategies, or(iii)the intrinsic difficulty to handle physical complexity with a linear superimposition of modes. All these aspects are avoided when employing DL-ROMs, which learn in a non-intrusive way both the nonlinear trial manifold and the reduced dynamics, by relying on deep (e.g., feedforward, convolutional, autoencoder) neural networks. Although extremely efficient at testing time, when evaluating the PDE solution for any new testing-parameter instance, DL-ROMs require an expensive training stage, because of the extremely large number of network parameters to be estimated. In this paper we propose a possible way to avoid an expensive training stage of DL-ROMs, by(i)performing a prior dimensionality reduction through POD, and(ii)relying on a multi-fidelity pretraining stage, where different physical models can be efficiently combined. The proposed POD-DL-ROM is tested on several (both scalar and vector, linear and nonlinear) time-dependent parametrized PDEs (such as, e.g., linear advection-diffusion-reaction, nonlinear diffusion-reaction, nonlinear elastodynamics, and Navier-Stokes equations) to show the generality of this approach and its remarkable computational savings.	reduced order modeling | deep learning | proper orthogonal decomposition | dimensionality reduction | parametrized PDEs

Shenzhen 212000 China email:	zlxiang@nuist.edu.cnC c.yang@ibotech.com.cn hekeqing@whu.edu.cn dr.hongrunwu@gmail.com ytma@whu.edu.cn	The bug triaging process, an essential process of assigning bug reports to the most appropriate developers, is related closely to the quality and costs of software development. As manual bug assignment is a labor-intensive task, especially for large-scale software projects, many machine-learning-based approaches have been proposed to automatically triage bug reports. Although developer collaboration networks (DCNs) are dynamic and evolving in the real-world, most automated bug triaging approaches focus on static tossing graphs at a single time slice. Also, none of the previous studies consider periodic interactions among developers. To address the problems mentioned above, in this article, we propose a novel spatial-temporal dynamic graph neural network (ST-DGNN) framework, including a joint random walk (JRWalk) mechanism and a graph recurrent convolutional neural network (GRCNN) model. In particular, JRWalk aims to sample local topological structures in a graph with two sampling strategies by considering both node importance and edge importance. GRCNN has three components with the same structure, i.e., hourly-periodic, daily-periodic, and weekly-periodic components, to learn the spatial-temporal features of dynamic DCNs. We evaluated our approach’s effectiveness by comparing it with several state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods in two domain-specific tasks that belong to node classification. In the two tasks, experiments on two real-world, large-scale developer collaboration networks collected from the Eclipse and Mozilla projects indicate that the proposed approach outperforms all the baseline methods.

Most narrow-linewidth lasers are implemented by actively suppressing their frequency noise through a frequency noise servo loop (FNSL). The loop bandwidths (LBW) of FNSLs are currently below megahertz, which is gradually tricky to meet application requirements, especially for wideband quantum sensing experiments. This article has experimentally implemented an FNSL with loop-delay-limited 3.5 MHz LBW, which is an order higher than the usual FNSLs. Using this FNSL, we achieved 70 dB laser frequency noise suppression over 100 kHz Fourier frequency range. This technology has broad applications in vast fields where wideband laser frequency noise suppression is inevitable.

The near SOL pressure and density decay lengths are obtained by leveraging a balance among the power source, perpendicular turbulent transport across the separatrix, and parallel losses at the vessel wall, while the far SOL pressure and density decay lengths are derived by using a model of intermittent transport mediated by filaments. The analytical estimates of the pressure decay length in the near SOL is then compared to the results of three-dimensional, flux-driven, global, two-fluid turbulence simulations of L-mode diverted tokamak plasmas, and validated against experimental measurements taken from an experimental multi-machine database of divertor heat flux profiles, showing in both cases a very good agreement. Analogously, the theoretical scaling law for the pressure decay length in the far SOL is compared to simulation results and to experimental measurements in TCV L-mode discharges, pointing out the need of a large multi-machine database for the far SOL decay lengths.

The, as well as C2 classRossi X-Ray Timing Explorerobservation, have been considered for analysis. We investigate the intensity variation of the source in different energy domains that correspond to different components of the accretion flow and infer the relative dominance of these flow components during the dip/flare events. We correlate the dependence of the dynamic photon index () with intensities in different energy bands and comment on the transition of the source to hard/soft phases during soft dips/flares. We also report the presence of sharp QPOs atHz corresponding to both softer and harder domain in the case ofvariability class of GRS 1915+105 and discuss the possible accretion flow configuration it suggests. Sharp QPO aroundmHz is observed inand C2 classes of IGR J17091-3624 in low and mid energy band (2.0-6.0 keV and 6.0-15.0 keV), but remains undetected in high energy (15.0-60.0 keV).

E-mails: {chenyx2 liwei fanrui 		Fluid simulations are often performed using the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE), leading to sparse linear systems which are difficult to solve efficiently in parallel. Recently, kinetic methods based on the adaptive-central-moment multiple-relaxation-time (ACM-MRT) model[1,2]have demonstrated impressive capabilities to simulate both laminar and turbulent flows, with quality matching or surpassing that of state-of-the-art INSE solvers. Furthermore, due to its local formulation, this method presents the opportunity for highly scalable implementations on parallel systems such as GPUs. However, an efficient ACM-MRT-based kinetic solver needs to overcome a number of computational challenges, especially when dealing with complex solids inside the fluid domain. In this paper, we present multiple novel GPU optimization techniques to efficiently implement high-quality ACM-MRT-based kinetic fluid simulations in domains containing complex solids. Our techniques include a new communication-efficient data layout, a load-balanced immersed-boundary method, a multi-kernel launch method using a simplified formulation of ACM-MRT calculations to enable greater parallelism, and the integration of these techniques into a parametric cost model to enable automated parameter search to achieve optimal execution performance. We also extended our method to multi-GPU systems to enable large-scale simulations. To demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and high visual quality of our solver, we present extensive experimental results and comparisons to other solvers.

The well-designed propagation mechanism which has been demonstrated effective is the most fundamental part of GNNs. Although most of GNNs basically follow a message passing manner, litter effort has been made to discover and analyze their essential relations. In this paper, we establish a surprising connection between different propagation mechanisms with a unified optimization problem, showing that despite the proliferation of various GNNs, in fact, their proposed propagation mechanisms are the optimal solution optimizing a feature fitting function over a wide class of graph kernels with a graph regularization term. Our proposed unified optimization framework, summarizing the commonalities between several of the most representative GNNs, not only provides a macroscopic view on surveying the relations between different GNNs, but also further opens up new opportunities for flexibly designing new GNNs. With the proposed framework, we discover that existing works usually utilize naïve graph convolutional kernels for feature fitting function, and we further develop two novel objective functions considering adjustable graph kernels showing low-pass or high-pass filtering capabilities respectively. Moreover, we provide the convergence proofs and expressive power comparisons for the proposed models. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets clearly show that the proposed GNNs not only outperform the state-of-the-art methods but also have good ability to alleviate over-smoothing, and further verify the feasibility for designing GNNs with our unified optimization framework.

In-meeting multitasking is closely linked to people’s productivity and wellbeing. However, we currently have limited understanding of multitasking in remote meetings and its potential impact. In this paper, we present what we believe is the most comprehensive study of remote meeting multitasking behavior through an analysis of a large-scale telemetry dataset collected from February to May 2020 of U.S. Microsoft employees and a 715-person diary study. Our results demonstrate that intrinsic meeting characteristics such as size, length, time, and type, significantly correlate with the extent to which people multitask, and multitasking can lead to both positive and negative outcomes. Our findings suggest important best-practice guidelines for remote meetings (e.g., avoid important meetings in the morning) and design implications for productivity tools (e.g., support positive remote multitasking).

Box 500 Batavia IL 60510 USAUniversity of California Davis One Shields Avenue Davis CA 95616 USA		Monte Carlo event generators are a critical tool for the interpretation of data obtained by neutrino experiments. Several modern event generators are available which are well-suited to the GeV energy scale used in studies of accelerator neutrinos. However, theoretical modeling differences make their immediate application to lower energies difficult. In this paper, I present a new event generator,MARLEY, which is designed to better address the simulation needs of the low-energy (tens of MeV and below) neutrino community.

The current release ofMARLEY(version 1.2.0) emphasizes simulations of the reactionbut is extensible to other channels with suitable user input. This paper provides detailed documentation ofMARLEY’s implementation and usage, including guidance on how generated events may be analyzed and howMARLEYmay be interfaced with external codes such as Geant4.

A fundamental parameter governing the efficiency of QLS solvers is, the condition number of the coefficient matrix, as it has been known since the inception of the QLS problem that for worst-case instances the runtime scales at least linearly in[1]. However, for the case of positive-definite matrices classical algorithms can solve linear systems with a runtime scaling as, a quadratic improvement compared to the the indefinite case. It is then natural to ask whether QLS solvers may hold an analogous improvement. In this work we answer the question in the negative, showing that solving a QLS entails a runtime linear inalso whenis positive definite. We then identify broad classes of positive-definite QLS where this lower bound can be circumvented and present two new quantum algorithms featuring a quadratic speed-up in: the first is based on efficiently implementing a matrix-block-encoding of, the second constructs a decomposition of the formto precondition the system. These methods are widely applicable and both allow to efficiently solveBQP-complete problems.

[2101.11870] Strategic Argumentation Dialogues for Persuasion: Framework and Experiments Based on Modelling the Beliefs and Concerns of the Persuadee	Emmanuel Hadoux Anthony Hunter Sylwia Polberg	Department of Computer Science University College London United KingdomScribe Labs London United Kingdom		Persuasion is an important and yet complex aspect of human intelligence. When undertaken through dialogue, the deployment of good arguments, and therefore counterarguments, clearly has a significant effect on the ability to be successful in persuasion. Two key dimensions for determining whether an argument is“good”in a particular dialogue are the degree to which the intended audience believes the argument and counterarguments, and the impact that the argument has on the concerns of the intended audience. In this paper, we present a framework for modelling persuadees in terms of their beliefs and concerns, and for harnessing these models in optimizing the choice of move in persuasion dialogues. Our approach is based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search which allows optimization in real-time. We provide empirical results of a study with human participants showing that our automated persuasion system based on this technology is superior to a baseline system that does not take the beliefs and concerns into account in its strategy.	
[2101.11871] Website Fingerprinting on Early QUIC Traffic	Pengwei Zhan Liming Wang Yi Tang	of Information Engineering Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing ChinaSchool of Cyber Security University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing China	ytang@gzhu.edu.cn wangliming@iie.ac.cn zhanpengwei@iie.ac.cn	Cryptographic protocols have been widely used to protect the user’s privacy and avoid exposing private information. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections), including the version originally designed by Google (GQUIC) and the version standardized by IETF (IQUIC), as alternatives to the traditional HTTP, demonstrate their unique transmission characteristics: based on UDP for encrypted resource transmitting, accelerating web page rendering. However, existing encrypted transmission schemes based on TCP are vulnerable to website fingerprinting (WFP) attacks, allowing adversaries to infer the users’ visited websites by eavesdropping on the transmission channel. Whether GQUIC and IQUIC can effectively resist such attacks is worth investigating. In this paper, we study the vulnerabilities of GQUIC, IQUIC, and HTTPS to WFP attacks from the perspective of traffic analysis. Extensive experiments show that, in the early traffic scenario, GQUIC is the most vulnerable to WFP attacks among GQUIC, IQUIC, and HTTPS, while IQUIC is more vulnerable than HTTPS, but the vulnerability of the three protocols is similar in the normal full traffic scenario. Features transferring analysis shows that most features are transferable between protocols when on normal full traffic scenario, which enable the adversary to use features proven effective on a special protocol efficiently attacking a new protocol. However, combining with the qualitative analysis of latent feature representation, we find that the transferring is inefficient when on early traffic, as GQUIC, IQUIC, and HTTPS show the significantly different magnitude of variation in the traffic distribution on early traffic. By upgrading the one-time WFP attacks to multiple WFP Top-attacks, we find that the attack accuracy on GQUIC and IQUIC reach 95.4% and 95.5%, respectively, with only 40 packets and just using simple features, whereas reach only 60.7% when on HTTPS. Finally, by conducting the attacks on flawed networks, we also demonstrate that the vulnerability of IQUIC is only slightly dependent on the network environment.

[2101.11872] Robust Extrinsic Regression Analysis for Manifold Valued Data	Hwiyoung		hwiyoung.lee@stat.fsu.edu	Recently, there has been a growing need in analyzing data on manifolds owing to their important role in diverse fields of science and engineering. In the literature of manifold-valued data analysis up till now, however, only a few works have been carried out concerning the robustness of estimation against noises, outliers, and other sources of perturbations. In this regard, we introduce a novel extrinsic framework for analyzing manifold valued data in a robust manner. First, by extending the notion of the geometric median, we propose a new robust location parameter on manifolds, so-called the extrinsic median. A robust extrinsic regression method is also developed by incorporating the conditional extrinsic median into the classical local polynomial regression method. We present the Weiszfeld’s algorithm for implementing the proposed methods. The promising performance of our approach against existing methods is illustrated through simulation studies.	Key words:

Recent deep learning models regard the task as a term-level matching problem, which seeks exact or similar query patterns in the document. However, we argue that they are inherently based on local interactions and do not generalise to ubiquitous, non-consecutive contextual relationships. In this work, we propose a novel relevance matching model based on graph neural networks to leverage the document-level word relationships for ad-hoc retrieval. In addition to the local interactions, we explicitly incorporate all contexts of a term through the graph-of-word text format. Matching patterns can be revealed accordingly to provide a more accurate relevance score. Our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines on two ad-hoc benchmarks. We also experimentally compare our model with BERT and show our advantages on long documents.

However, there still exsit sizable uncertainties from the four-quark operator matrix elements in the power of. In this work, the leading order results of the four-quark operator matrix elementsandare obtained using full QCD sum rules. Contributions from dimension-0,3,5 are considered. It turns out that the contributions from dimension-3,5 are proportional to the mass ofquark. Stable Borel region can be found, and for this reason, the uncertainties caused by the QCD sum rule parameters are small. The leading logarithmic corrections are also considered, which turn out to be a little destructive. Our results are close to the lower bound of the existing theoretical predictions.

As an example, we consider the model with a Brans-Dicke kinetic termand a quadratic scalar potential, which reduces to general relativity (GR) in the limit, and the cosmological constant in the limit. In such a model the scalar field typically rolls down the potential and oscillates around the minimum of. We find that the model parameter estimate for the CMB+BAO+RSD data set is given by(is defined in Eq.3), corresponding to, and. However, the GRCDM model can fit the data almost as good as this extended quintessence model, and is favored by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The variation of the gravitational constant since the epoch of Recombination is constrained to be. In light of recent report that the CMB data favors a closed universe, we consider the case with non-flat geometry in our fit, and find that the mean value ofshifts a little bit fromto, and the parameters in our model are not degenerate with.

Ryan	institutetext:		The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt, Germany, provides unique possibilities for a new generation of hadron-, nuclear- and atomic physics experiments. The future antiProton ANnihilations at DArmstadt (PANDA orANDA) experiment at FAIR will offer a broad physics programme, covering different aspects of the strong interaction. Understanding the latter in the non-perturbative regime remains one of the greatest challenges in contemporary physics. The antiproton-nucleon interaction studied with PANDA provides crucial tests in this area. Furthermore, the high-intensity, low-energy domain of PANDA allows for searches for physics beyond the Standard Model,e.g.through high precision symmetry tests. This paper takes into account a staged approach for the detector setup and for the delivered luminosity from the accelerator. The available detector setup at the time of the delivery of the first antiproton beams in the HESR storage ring is referred to as thePhase Onesetup. The physics programme that is achievable during Phase One is outlined in this paper.	pacs:07.05.FbDesign of experiments and 29.30.-hSpectrometers and spectroscopic techniques and 24.85.+pQuarks | gluons | and QCD in nuclear reactions and 13.75.-nHadron-induced low- and intermediate-energy reactions and scattering and 21.30.FeForces in hadronic systems and effective interactions and 25.43.+tAntiproton-induced reactions and 13.40.GpElectromagnetic form factors and 14.20.JnHyperons and 13.75.EvHyperon-nucleon interactions and 14.40.-nMesons and 14.40.PqHeavy quarkonia and 14.40.RtExotic mesons and 14.40.LbCharmed mesons and 13.30.-aBaryon decay and 13.60.RjBaryon production and 13.88.+ePolarization in interactions and scattering
[2101.11878] COMPAS: Representation Learning with Compositional Part Sharing for Few-Shot Classification	Ju He Adam Kortylewski Alan YuilleJohns Hopkins University			Few-shot image classification consists of two consecutive learning processes: 1) In the meta-learning stage, the model acquires a knowledge base from a set of training classes. 2) During meta-testing, the acquired knowledge is used to recognize unseen classes from very few examples. Inspired by the compositional representation of objects in humans, we train a neural network architecture that explicitly represents objects as a set of parts and their spatial composition. In particular, during meta-learning, we train a knowledge base that consists of a dictionary of part representations and a dictionary of part activation maps that encode common spatial activation patterns of parts. The elements of both dictionaries are shared among the training classes. During meta-testing, the representation of unseen classes is learned using the part representations and the part activation maps from the knowledge base. Finally, an attention mechanism is used to strengthen those parts that are most important for each category. We demonstrate the value of our compositional learning framework for a few-shot classification using miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and FC100, where we achieve state-of-the-art performance.

[2101.11882] Forecast for cosmological parameter estimation with gravitational-wave standard sirens from the LISA-Taiji network	Ling-Feng Wang Shang-Jie Jin Jing-Fei Zhang Xin Zhang111Corresponding author	Department of Physics College of Sciences Northeastern University Shenyang 110819 China	zhangxin@mail.neu.edu.cn	LISA and Taiji are expected to form a space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detection network in the future. In this work, we make a forecast for the cosmological parameter estimation with the standard siren observation from the LISA-Taiji network. We simulate the standard siren data based on a scenario with configuration angle ofbetween LISA and Taiji. Three models for the population of massive black hole binary (MBHB), i.e., pop III, Q3d, and Q3nod, are considered to predict the events of MBHB mergers. We find that, based on the LISA-Taiji network, the number of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts detected is almost doubled compared with the case of single Taiji mission. Therefore, the LISA-Taiji network’s standard siren observation could provide much tighter constraints on cosmological parameters. For example, solely using the standard sirens from the LISA-Taiji network, the constraint precision ofcould reach. Moreover, combined with the CMB data, the GW-EM observation based on the LISA-Taiji network could also tightly constrain the equation of state of dark energy, e.g., the constraint precision ofreaches about, which is comparable with the result of CMB+BAO+SN. It is concluded that the GW standard sirens from the LISA-Taiji network will become a useful cosmological probe in understanding the nature of dark energy in the future.	gravitational wave | space-based | network

They are employed to routinely deliver high-quality neural network architectures for various challenging data sets and reduce the designer’s effort. The NAS methods utilizing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are especially useful when the objective is not only to minimize the network error but also to minimize the number of parameters (weights) or power consumption of the inference phase. We propose a multi-objective NAS method based on Cartesian genetic programming for evolving convolutional neural networks (CNN). The method allows approximate operations to be used in CNNs to reduce power consumption of a target hardware implementation. During the NAS process, a suitable CNN architecture is evolved together with approximate multipliers to deliver the best trade-offs between the accuracy, network size and power consumption. The most suitable approximate multipliers are automatically selected from a library of approximate multipliers. Evolved CNNs are compared with common human-created CNNs of a similar complexity on the CIFAR-10 benchmark problem.

Paulson School of Engineering & Applied Sciences Harvard University Cambridge MA 02138 USA.	lukas.ortmann@rwth-aachen.de	The human insulin-glucose metabolism is a time-varying process, which is partly caused by the changing insulin sensitivity of the body. This insulin sensitivity follows a circadian rhythm and its effects should be anticipated by any automated insulin delivery system. This paper presents an extension of our previous work on automated insulin delivery by developing a controller suitable for humans with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Furthermore, we enhance the controller with a new kernel function for the Gaussian Process and deal with noisy measurements, as well as, the noisy training data for the Gaussian Process, arising therefrom. This enables us to move the proposed control algorithm, a combination of Model Predictive Controller and a Gaussian Process, closer towards clinical application. Simulation results on the University of Virginia/Padova FDA-accepted metabolic simulator are presented for a meal schedule with random carbohydrate sizes and random times of carbohydrate uptake to show the performance of the proposed control scheme.

[2101.11888] Does Typological Blinding Impede Cross-Lingual Sharing?	Johannes BjervaDepartment of Computer ScienceAalborg  AugensteinDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of		jbjerva@cs.aau.dk augenstein@di.ku.dk	Bridging the performance gap between high- and low-resource languages has been the focus of much previous work. Typological features from databases such as the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) are a prime candidate for this, as such data exists even for very low-resource languages. However, previous work has only found minor benefits from using typological information. Our hypothesis is that a model trained in a cross-lingual setting will pick up on typological cues from the input data, thus overshadowing the utility of explicitly using such features. We verify this hypothesis by blinding a model to typological information, and investigate how cross-lingual sharing and performance is impacted. Our model is based on a cross-lingual architecture in which the latent weights governing the sharing between languages is learnt during training. We show that (i) preventing this model from exploiting typology severely reduces performance, while a control experiment reaffirms that (ii) encouraging sharing according to typology somewhat improves performance.

In this work, these components are instantiated with graph neural networks (GNNs), Deep Energy Estimator Networks (DEEN) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), respectively. This implementation is used to identify 120K molecules (out of 40-million explored) which the GNN determined to be likely SARS-CoV-1 inhibitors, and, at the same time, are statistically close to the dataset used to train the GNN.

The segregation of claims is complex, owing to the divergence in textual syntax and context across different distributions.

In this paper, we proposeLESA, a framework which aims at advancing headfirst into expunging the former issue by assembling a source-independent generalized model that captures syntactic features through part-of-speech and dependency embeddings, as well as contextual features through a fine-tuned language model. We resolve the latter issue by annotating a Twitter dataset which aims at providing a testing ground on a large unstructured dataset. Experimental results show thatLESAimproves upon the state-of-the-art performance across six benchmark claim datasets by an average of 3 claim-F1 points for in-domain experiments and by 2 claim-F1 points for general-domain experiments. On our dataset too,LESAoutperforms existing baselines by 1 claim-F1 point on the in-domain experiments and 2 claim-F1 points on the general-domain experiments. We also release comprehensive data annotation guidelines compiled during the annotation phase (which was missing in the current literature).

Umemori	Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) 305-0801 Tsukuba Ibaraki Japan	hayato.ito@kek.jp	The performance of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities depends on the niobium surface condition. Recently, various heat-treatment methods have been investigated to achieve unprecedented high quality factor (Q) and high accelerating field (E). We report the influence of a new baking process called furnace baking on the Q-E behavior of 1.3 GHz SRF cavities. Furnace baking is performed as the final step of the cavity surface treatment; the cavities are heated in a vacuum furnace for 3 h, followed by high-pressure rinsing and radio-frequency measurement. This method is simpler and potentially more reliable than previously reported heat-treatment methods, and it is therefore, easier to apply to the SRF cavities. We find that the quality factor is increased after furnace baking at temperatures ranging from 300C to 400C, while strong decreasing the quality factor at high accelerating field is observed after furnace baking at temperatures ranging from 600C to 800C. We find significant differences in the surface resistance for various processing temperatures.

[2101.11894] Metastability for the Ising model on the hexagonal lattice	Valentina Apollonio Vanessa Jacquier Francesca Romana Nardi Alessio Troiani	Dipartimento di Matematica e Fisica Università Roma Tre		We consider the Ising model on the hexagonal lattice evolving according to Metropolis dynamics. We study its metastable behavior in the limit of vanishing temperature when the system is immersed in a small external magnetic field. We determine the asymptotic properties of the transition time from the metastable to the stable state up to a multiplicative factor and study the mixing time and the spectral gap of the Markov process. We give a geometrical description of the critical configurations and show how not only their size but their shape varies depending on the thermodynamical parameters. Finally we provide some results concerning polyiamonds of maximal area and minimal perimeter.

[2101.11895] Survival probability of a run-and-tumble particle in the presence of a drift	Benjamin De Bruyne Satya N. Majumdar Grégory Schehr	LPTMS CNRS Univ. Paris-Sud Université Paris-Saclay 91405 Orsay France	benjamin.debruyne@centraliens.net satya.majumdar@universite-paris-saclay.fr gregory.schehr@u-psud.fr	We consider a one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle, or persistent random walk, in the presence of an absorbing boundary located at the origin. After each tumbling event, which occurs at a constant rate, the (new) velocity of the particle is drawn randomly from a distribution. We study the survival probabilityof a particle starting fromup to timeand obtain an explicit expression for its double Laplace transform (with respect to bothand) for anarbitraryvelocity distribution, not necessarily symmetric. This result is obtained as a consequence of Spitzer’s formula, which is well known in the theory of random walks and can be viewed as a generalization of the Sparre Andersen theorem. We then apply this general result to the specific case of a two-state particle with velocity, the so-called persistent random walk (PRW), and in the presence of a constant driftand obtain an explicit expression for, for which we present more detailed results. Depending on the drift, we find a rich variety of behaviours for, leading to three distinct cases: (i)subcriticaldrift, (ii)supercriticaldriftand (iii)criticaldrift. In these three cases, we obtain exact analytical expressions for the survival probabilityand establish connections with existing formulae in the mathematics literature. Finally, we discuss some applications of these results to record statistics and to the statistics of last-passage times.	Keywords

In the training process of FL, no party has a global view of data distributions or model architectures of other parties. Thus the manually-designed architectures may not be optimal. In the past, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been applied to FL to address this critical issue. However, existing Federated NAS approaches require prohibitive communication and computation effort, as well as the availability of high-quality labels. In this work, we present Self-supervised Vertical Federated Neural Architecture Search (SS-VFNAS) for automating FL where participants hold feature-partitioned data, a common cross-silo scenario called Vertical Federated Learning (VFL). In the proposed framework, each party first conducts NAS using self-supervised approach to find a local optimal architecture with its own data. Then, parties collaboratively improve the local optimal architecture in a VFL framework with supervision. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach has superior performance, communication efficiency and privacy compared to Federated NAS and is capable of generating high-performance and highly-transferable heterogeneous architectures even with insufficient overlapping samples, providing automation for those parties without deep learning expertise.111This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

The gold standard is instead to evaluate these aspects through user studies, especially subjective evaluations of video stimuli. Common evaluation paradigms either present individual stimuli to be scored on Likert-type scales, or ask users to compare and rate videos in a pairwise fashion. However, the time and resources required for such evaluations scale poorly as the number of conditions to be compared increases. Building on standards used for evaluating the quality of multimedia codecs, this paper instead introduces a framework for granular rating of multiple comparable videos in parallel. This methodology essentially analyses all condition pairs at once. Our contributions are 1) a proposed framework, called HEMVIP, for parallel and granular evaluation of multiple video stimuli and 2) a validation study confirming that results obtained using the tool are in close agreement with results of prior studies using conventional multiple pairwise comparisons.	evaluation paradigms | video evaluation | conversational agents | gesture generation

We further show that properly stratified Gorenstein algebrasenjoy strong homological properties such as all Gorenstein projective modules being properly stratified and all endomorphism ringsbeing Frobenius algebras. We apply our results to the study of properly stratified algebras that are minimal Auslander-Gorenstein algebras in the sense of Iyama-Solberg and calculate under suitable conditions their Ringel duals. This applies in particular to all centraliser algebras of nilpotent matrices.

Interestingly, it has been shown that non-Markovianity can be used to speed-up the dynamics[1]and to lower the QSL time, although this behavior is not universal[2]. In this paper we further carry on the investigation on the connection between QSL and non-Markovianity by looking at the effects of P- and CP-divisibility of the dynamical map to the quantum speed limit. We show that the speed-up can also be observed under P- and CP-divisible dynamics, and that the speed-up is not necessarily tied to the transition from P-divisible to non-P-divisible dynamics.

Email:	alessandro.girardi@upbilancio.it roy.cerqueti@uniroma1.it raffaella.coppier@unimc.it marco.ventura@uniroma1.it	This paper estimates the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions – mainly, the lockdown – on the COVID-19 mortality rate for the case of Italy, the first Western country to impose a national shelter-in-place order. We use a new estimator, the Augmented Synthetic Control Method (ASCM), that overcomes some limits of the standard Synthetic Control Method (SCM). The results are twofold. From a methodological point of view, the ASCM outperforms the SCM in that the latter cannot select a valid donor set, assigning all the weights to only one country (Spain) while placing zero weights to all the remaining. From an empirical point of view, we find strong evidence of the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in avoiding losses of human lives in Italy: conservative estimates indicate that for each human life actually lost, in the absence of lockdown there would have been on average other 1.15, the policy saved in total 20,400 human lives.

Hanoi VietnamFaculty of Computer Science Phenikaa University Yen Nghia Ha Dong Dist. Hanoi 12116 Vietnam	lam.phamtien@phenikaa-uni.edu.vn	We demonstrate a machine learning approach designed to extract hidden chemistry/physics to facilitate new materials discovery. In particular, we propose a novel method for learning latent knowledge from material structure data in which machine learning models are developed to present the possibility that an atom can be paired with a chemical environment in an observed materials. For this purpose, we trained deep neural networks acquiring information from the atom of interest and its environment to estimate the possibility. The models were then used to establish recommendation systems, which can suggest a list of atoms for an environment within a structure. The center atom of that environment was then replaced with the various recommended atoms to generate new structures. Based on these recommendations, we also propose a method of dissimilarity measurement between the atoms and, through hierarchical cluster analysis and visualization using the multidimensional scaling algorithm, illustrate that this dissimilarity can reflect the chemistry of the elements. Finally, our models were applied to the discovery of new structures in the well-known magnetic material NdFeB. Our models propose 108 new structures, 71 of which are confirmed to converge to local-minimum-energy structures with formation energy less than 0.1 eV by first-principles calculations.

[2101.11903] Low-density neutron matter and the unitary limit	Isaac Vidaña	Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare Sezione di Catania Dipartimento di Fisica “Ettore Majorana” Università di Catania Via Santa Sofia 64 I-95123 Catania Italy		We review the properties of neutron matter in the low-density regime. In particular, we revise its ground state energy and the superfluid neutron pairing gap, and analyze their evolution from the weak to the strong coupling regime. The calculations of the energy and the pairing gap are performed, respectively, within the Brueckner–Hartree–Fock approach of nuclear matter and the BCS theory using the chiral nucleon-nucleon interaction of Entem and Machleidt at NLO and the Argonne V18 phenomenological potential. Results for the energy are also shown for a simple Gaussian potential with a strength and range adjusted to reproduce theneutron-neutron scattering length and effective range. Our results are compared with those of quantum Monte Carlo calculations for neutron matter and cold atoms. The Tan contact parameter in neutron matter is also calculated finding a reasonable agreement with experimental data with ultra-cold atoms only at very low densities. We find that low-density neutron matter exhibits a behavior close to that of a Fermi gas at the unitary limit, although, this limit is actually never reached. We also review the properties (energy, effective mass and quasiparticle residue) of a spin-down neutron impurity immersed in a low-density free Fermi gas of spin-up neutrons already studied by the author in a recent work where it was shown that these properties are very close to those of an attractive Fermi polaron in the unitary limit.

In this study we developed a novel vertex finding algorithm for future lepton colliders such as the International Linear Collider. We deploy two networks: one consists of simple fully-connected layers to look for vertex seeds from track pairs, and the other is a customized Recurrent Neural Network with an attention mechanism and an encoder-decoder structure to associate tracks to the vertex seeds. The performance of the vertex finder is compared with the standard ILC vertex reconstruction algorithm.	International Linear Collider | Vertex Finding | Recurrent Neural Network | Attention
[2101.11907] The fraud loss for selecting the model complexity in fraud detection	Simon Boge Brant Ingrid Hobæk Haff		simonbb@math.uio.no	In fraud detection applications, the investigator is typically limited to controlling a restricted numberof cases. The most efficient manner of allocating the resources is then to try selecting thecases with the highest probability of being fraudulent. The prediction model used for this purpose must normally be regularized to avoid overfitting and consequently bad prediction performance. A new loss function, denoted the fraud loss, is proposed for selecting the model complexity via a tuning parameter. A simulation study is performed to find the optimal settings for validation. Further, the performance of the proposed procedure is compared to the most relevant competing procedure, based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), in a set of simulations, as well as on a VAT fraud dataset. In most cases, choosing the complexity of the model according to the fraud loss, gave a better than, or comparable performance to the AUC in terms of the fraud loss.

It is shown that the regular spacetime point operators form a Banach manifold endowed with a canonical Fréchet-smooth Riemannian metric. The so-called expedient differential calculus is introduced with the purpose of treating derivatives of functions on Banach spaces which are differentiable only in certain directions. A chain rule is proven for Hölder continuous functions which are differentiable on expedient subspaces. These results are made applicable to causal fermion systems by proving that the causal Lagrangian is Hölder continuous. Moreover, Hölder continuity is analyzed for the integrated causal Lagrangian.

[2101.11911] The Role of Syntactic Planning in Compositional Image Captioning	Emanuele Bugliarello Desmond ElliottDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of			Image captioning has focused on generalizing to images drawn from the same distribution as the training set, and not to the more challenging problem of generalizing to different distributions of images. Recently,Nikolaus et al. (2019)introduced a dataset to assess compositional generalization in image captioning, where models are evaluated on their ability to describe images with unseen adjective–noun and noun–verb compositions. In this work, we investigate different methods to improve compositional generalization by planning the syntactic structure of a caption. Our experiments show that jointly modeling tokens and syntactic tags enhances generalization in both RNN- and Transformer-based models, while also improving performance on standard metrics.

MacLeod Jakobus M. Vorster Tomoya Hirota Crystal L. Brogan Todd R. Hunter Ruby van Rooyen	Centre for Space Research Potchefstroom campus North-West University Potchefstroom 2531 South AfricaDepartment of Physics and Astronomy Faculty of Physical Sciences University of Nigeria Carver Building 1 University Road Nsukka 410001 Nigeria		Following an eruptive accretion event in NGC 6334I-MM1, flares in the various maser species, including water masers, were triggered. We report the observed relative proper motion of the highly variable water masers associated with the massive star-forming region, NGC 6334I. High velocity HO maser proper motions were detected in 5 maser clusters, CM2-W2 (bow-shock structure), MM1-W1, MM1-W3, UCHII-W1 and UCHII-W3. The overall average of the derived relative proper motion is 85 km s. This mean proper motion is in agreement with the previous results from VLA multi-epoch observations. Our position and velocity variance and co-variance matrix analyses of the maser proper motions show its major axis to have a position angle of, cutting through the dust cavity around MM1B and aligned in the northwest-southeast direction. We interpret this as the axis of the jet driving the CM2 shock and the maser motion. The complicated proper motions in MM1-W1 can be explained by the combined influence of the MM1 northeast-southwest bipolar outflow, CS(6-5) north-south collimated bipolar outflow, and the radio jet. The relative proper motions of the HO masers in UCHII-W1 are likely not driven by the jets of MM1B protostar but by MM3-UCHII. Overall, the post-accretion burst relative proper motions of the HO masers trace shocks of jet motion.

It is shown that, if the source has a relatively small uncertainty while the particle encircles it, an effective magnetic vector potential arises and the final state of the joint system is approximately a tensor product. Furthermore, if a post-selection of the source is considered, the effective vector potential is, in general, complex-valued. This leads to a new prediction in the Aharonov-Bohm scenario before the magnetic field is fully enclosed that has a parallel with Berry phases in open quantum systems. Also, new insights into the correspondence principle, which makes complex vector potentials relevant in the study of classical systems, are discussed.	
[2101.11915] Detecting Malicious Accounts showing Adversarial Behavior in Permissionless Blockchains	Rachit AgarwalIIT-Kanpur Tanmay ThapliyalIIT-Kanpur Sandeep K ShuklaIIT-Kanpur			Different types of malicious activities have been flagged in multiple permissionless blockchains such as bitcoin, Ethereum etc. While some malicious activities exploit vulnerabilities in the infrastructure of the blockchain, some target its users through social engineering techniques. To address these problems, we aim at automatically flagging blockchain accounts that originate such malicious exploitation of accounts of other participants. To that end, we identify a robust supervised machine learning (ML) algorithm that is resistant to any bias induced by an over representation of certain malicious activity in the available dataset, as well as is robust against adversarial attacks. We find that most of the malicious activities reported thus far, for example, in Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, behaves statistically similar. Further, the previously used ML algorithms for identifying malicious accounts show bias towards a particular malicious activity which is over-represented. In the sequel, we identify that Neural Networks (NN) holds up the best in the face of such bias inducing dataset at the same time being robust against certain adversarial attacks.

The field of Music Information Retrieval is not exempt from this issue. Even if fields such as Musicology or Sociology of Music have a long tradition in questioning the representation and the impact of diversity in cultural environments, such knowledge has not been yet embedded into the design and development of music technologies. In this paper, focusing on electronic music, we investigate the characteristics of listeners, artists, and tracks that are influential in the perception of diversity. Specifically, we center our attention on 1) understanding the relationship between perceived diversity and computational methods to measure diversity, and 2) analyzing how listeners’ domain knowledge and familiarity influence such perceived diversity. To accomplish this, we design a user-study wherein listeners are asked to compare pairs of lists of tracks and artists, and to select the most diverse list from each pair. We compare participants’ ratings with results obtained through computational models built using audio tracks’ features and artist attributes. We find that such models are generally aligned with participants’ choices when most of them agree that one list is more diverse than the other. In addition, we observe how differences in domain knowledge, familiarity, and demographics influence the level of agreement among listeners, and between listeners and computational diversity metrics.	music information retrieval; diversity; reliability;

An implementation scheme of the-dimensional Fourier transform acting on single photons is known that uses the path encoding and requiresoptical elements. In this paper we present an alternative design that uses the orbital angular momentum as a carrier of information and needs onlyelements, rendering the path-encoded design inefficient. The advantageous scaling and the fact that our approach uses only conventional optical elements allows for the implementation of a 256-dimensional Fourier transform with the existing technology. Improvements of our design, as well as explicit setups for low dimensions, are also presented.

Another important feature of the gravitational optics’ implementation is its geometry with the paraxial approximation, when quantum mechanics, in particular, fractional quantum mechanics, is an effective description of optical effects. In this case, fractional-time differentiation reflexes this geometry effect as well.

The celebrated mass-energy equivalence relation,, is derived by Einstein using thought experiments involving the kinematics of the emission of light (electromagnetic energy) and the relativity principle. Text book derivations often follow paths similar to Einstein’s, or the analysis of the kinematics of particle collisions interpreted from the perspective of different inertial frames. All the same, in such derivations the direct dynamical link with hypothetical fundamental fields describing matter (e.g. Maxwell theory or other) is overshadowed by the use of powerful symmetry arguments, kinematics, and the relativity principle.

Prof. Gama Pinto 2 1649-003 Lisbon Portugal and Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) Universidade de Lisboa Av. Rovisco Pais 1 1049-001 Lisbon PortugalComputer Architecture and Technology Department University of Granada Granada Spain		This paper presents several approaches to deal with the problem of identifying muons in a water Cherenkov detector with a reduced water volume and 4 PMTs. Different perspectives of information representation are used and new features are engineered using the specific domain knowledge. As results show, these new features, in combination with the convolutional layers, are able to achieve a good performance avoiding overfitting and being able to generalise properly for the test set. The results also prove that the combination of state-of-the-art Machine Learning analysis techniques and water Cherenkov detectors with low water depth can be used to efficiently identify muons, which may lead to huge investment savings due to the reduction of the amount of water needed at high altitudes. This achievement can be used in further research to be able to discriminate between gamma and hadron induced showers using muons as discriminant.

[2101.11925] First-passage time theory of activated rate chemical processes in electronic molecular junctions	Riley J. Preston Maxim F. Gelin Daniel S. Kosov	College of Science and Engineering James Cook University Townsville QLD 4811 Australia		Confined nanoscale spaces, electric fields and tunneling currents make the molecular electronic junction an experimental device for the discovery of new, out-of-equilibrium chemical reactions. Reaction-rate theory for current-activated chemical reactions is developed by combining a Keldysh nonequilibrium Green’s functions treatment of electrons, Fokker-Planck description of the reaction coordinate, and Kramers’ first-passage time calculations. The NEGF provide an adiabatic potential as well as a diffusion coefficient and temperature with local dependence on the reaction coordinate. Van Kampen’s Fokker-Planck equation, which describes a Brownian particle moving in an external potential in an inhomogeneous medium with a position-dependent friction and diffusion coefficient, is used to obtain an analytic expression for the first-passage time. The theory is applied to several transport scenarios: a molecular junction with a single, reaction coordinate dependent molecular orbital, and a model diatomic molecular junction. We demonstrate the natural emergence of Landauer’s blowtorch effect as a result of the interplay between the configuration dependent viscosity and diffusion coefficients. The resultant localized heating in conjunction with the bond-deformation due to current-induced forces are shown to be the determining factors when considering chemical reaction rates; each of which result from highly tunable parameters within the system.	
[2101.11926] Modified strong-coupling treatment of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg trimerized chain developed from the exactly solved Ising-Heisenberg diamond chain	Taras Verkholyak Jozef Strečka	Institute for Condensed Matter Physics NASU 1 Svientsitskii Street L’viv-11 79011 Ukraine		Quantum spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimerized chain with strong intradimer and weak monomer-dimer coupling constants is studied using the novel many-body perturbation expansion, which is developed from the exactly solved spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg diamond chain preserving correlations between all interacting spins of the trimerized chain. It is evidenced that the novel perturbation approach is superior with respect to the standard perturbation scheme developed from a set of noninteracting spin monomers and dimers, whereas its accuracy even coincides up a moderate ratio of the coupling constants with the state-of-the-art numerical techniques. The Heisenberg trimerized chain shows the intermediate one-third plateau, which was also observed in the magnetization curve of the polymeric compound Cu(POOH)affording its experimental realization. Within the modified strong-coupling method we have obtained the effective Hamiltonians for the magnetic-field range from zero to one-third plateau, and from one-third plateau to the saturation magnetization. The unconventional second-order perturbation theory provides extremely accurate results for both critical fields of the intermediate one-third plateau up to the moderate ratio of the coupling constants as convincingly evidenced through a comparison with numerical density-matrix renormalization group data. It is shown that the derived effective Hamiltonian also provides at low enough temperatures sufficiently accurate results for magnetization curves and thermodynamic properties as corroborated through a comparison with quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Using the results for the effective Hamiltonian we additionally suggest straightforward procedure for finding the microscopic parameters of one-dimensional trimerized magnetic compounds with strong intradimer and weak monomer-dimer couplings. We found the refined values for the coupling constants of Cu(POOH)by matching the theoretical results with the available experimental data for the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility in a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields.	trimerized Heisenberg chain | strong-coupling approach | magnetization plateau | thermodynamics

In more detail, we study a two-level system for electrons and holes endowed with an intermediate energy level for electrons occupying trapped states. As our main result, we establish an explicit functional inequality between relative entropy and entropy production, which leads to exponential convergence to equilibrium. We stress that our approach is applied uniformly in the lifetime of electrons on the trap level assuming that this lifetime is sufficiently small.

We find that such density matrix asymptotically reaches a Gibbs state. The particularities of its evolution towards this state are encoded in the response function, which depends on the dimension, the properties of the fields, and the specific coupling to them. We also compare this situation with the thermalization of a static detector immersed in a thermal field state, pinpointing the differences between both scenarios. In particular, we analyze the role of the response function and its effect on the evolution of the detector towards equilibrium. Furthermore, we explore the consequences of the well-known statistics inversion of the response function of an Unruh-DeWitt detector linearly coupled to a free scalar field in odd spacetime dimensions. This allows us to specify in which sense accelerated detectors in Minkowski vacuum behave as static detectors in a thermal bath and in which sense they do not.

In this work, its rules and characteristics are presented, then a study on its complexity is reported. An upper bound to its complexity is found eventually by dividing the state-space of the game into subspaces according to specific conditions. This upper bound is comparable to the one found for Draughts, therefore, it would seem that the open challenge of solving this game requires a considerable computational effort.

Recent advances in machine learning have enabled the development of models using a wider range of data, including imaging. Radiomics aims to extract quantitative predictive and prognostic biomarkers from routine medical imaging, but evidence for computed tomography radiomics for prognosis remains inconclusive. We have conducted an institutional machine learning challenge to develop an accurate model for overall survival prediction in head and neck cancer using clinical data etxracted from electronic medical records and pre-treatment radiological images, as well as to evaluate the true added benefit of radiomics for head and neck cancer prognosis. Using a large, retrospective dataset of 2,552 patients and a rigorous evaluation framework, we compared 12 different submissions using imaging and clinical data, separately or in combination. The winning approach used non-linear, multitask learning on clinical data and tumour volume, achieving high prognostic accuracy for 2-year and lifetime survival prediction and outperforming models relying on clinical data only, engineered radiomics and deep learning. Combining all submissions in an ensemble model resulted in improved accuracy, with the highest gain from a image-based deep learning model. Our results show the potential of machine learning and simple, informative prognostic factors in combination with large datasets as a tool to guide personalized cancer care.

Giazotto	Istituto Nanoscienze-CNR and Scuola Normale Superiore I-56127 Pisa Italy	andrea.iorio@sns.it	We theoretically investigate a quantum heat diode based on two interacting flux qubits coupled to two heat baths. Rectification of heat currents is achieved by asymmetrically coupling the qubits to the reservoirs modelled as dissipativeresonators. We find that the coherent interaction between the qubits can be exploited to enhance the rectification factor, which otherwise would be constrained by the baths temperatures and couplings. Remarkably high values of rectification ratio up tocan be obtained for realistic system parameters, with an enhancement up tocompared to the non-interacting case. The system features the possibility of manipulating both the rectification amplitude and direction, allowing for an enhancement or suppression of the heat flow to a chosen bath. For the regime of parameters in which rectification is maximized, we find a significant increase of the rectification above a critical interaction value which corresponds to the onset of a non vanishing entanglement in the system. Finally, we discuss the dependence of the rectification factor on the bath temperatures and couplings.

Tamás KrisztinInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis andPhilipp PiribauerAustrian Institute of Economic Research	thanks:		We develop a Bayesian approach to estimate weight matrices in spatial autoregressive (or spatial lag) models. Datasets in regional economic literature are typically characterized by a limited number of time periodsrelative to spatial units. When the spatial weight matrix is subject to estimation severe problems of over-parametrization are likely. To make estimation feasible, our approach focusses on spatial weight matrices which are binary prior to row-standardization. We discuss the use of hierarchical priors which impose sparsity in the spatial weight matrix. Monte Carlo simulations show that these priors perform very well where the number of unknown parameters is large relative to the observations. The virtues of our approach are demonstrated using global data from the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.	
[2101.11939] Exploring Cross-Image Pixel Contrast for Semantic Segmentation	Wenguan Wang Tianfei Zhou Fisher Yu Jifeng Dai Ender Konukoglu Luc Van GoolComputer Vision Lab ETH ZurichSenseTime Research	The first two authors contribute equally to this work.		Current semantic segmentation methods focus only on mining “local” context,\ie, dependencies between pixels within individual images, by context-aggregation modules (\eg, dilated convolution, neural attention) or structure-aware optimization criteria (\eg, IoU-like loss). However, they ignore “global” context of the training data,\ie, rich semantic relations between pixels across different images. Inspired by recent advance in unsupervised contrastive representation learning, we propose a pixel-wise contrastive algorithm for semantic segmentation in the fully supervised setting. The core idea is to enforce pixel embeddings belonging to a same semantic class to be more similar than embeddings from different classes. It raises a pixel-wise metric learning paradigm for semantic segmentation, by explicitly exploring the structures of labeled pixels, which were rarely explored before. Our method can be effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks without extra overhead during testing. We experimentally show that, with famous segmentation models (\ie, DeepLabV3, HRNet, OCR) and backbones (\ie, ResNet, HRNet), our method brings performance improvements across diverse datasets (\ie, Cityscapes, PASCAL-Context, COCO-Stuff, CamVid). We expect this work will encourage our community to rethink the current de facto training paradigm in semantic segmentation.111Our code will be available athttps://github.com/tfzhou/ContrastiveSeg.

Remarkably, the emission direction of this micro-lighthouse is continuously controlled by the linear polarization of the incident laser, and angular beam steering overis demonstrated. Theoretically, this unprecedented effect arises from the interplay between the nonlinear optical response of microcavity exciton-polaritons, the difference in the subcavities forming the microcavity, and the rotational invariance of the device.

In this work, the piezoelectric properties of 2D topological insulators InXO (X=Se and Te) from monolayer InX (X=Se and Te) with double-side oxygen functionalization are studied by density functional theory (DFT). The large piezoelectric strain coefficients (e.g.=-13.02 pm/V for InSeO and=-9.64 pm/V for InTeO) are predicted, which are comparable and even higher than ones of many other familiar 2D materials. Moreover, we propose two strategies to enhance piezoelectric response of monolayer InXO (X=Se and Te). Firstly, the biaxial strain (0.94-1.06) is applied, and the(absolute value) is increased by 53%/56% for monolayer InSeO/InTeO at 1.06 strain, which is due to increased(absolute value) and reduced. In considered strain range, InXO (X=Se and Te) monolayers are always 2D topological insulators, which confirm the coexistence of piezoelectricity and nontrivial band topology. Secondly, a Janus monolayeris designed by replacing the top Se/Te atomic layer in monolayer InSeO/InTeO with Te/Se atoms, which is dynamically and mechanically stable. More excitingly, Janus monolayeris also a 2D topological insulator with sizeable bulk gap up to 0.158 eV, confirming the coexistence of intrinsic piezoelectricity and topological nature. The calculatedis -9.9 pm/V, which is in the middle of ones of InSeO and InTeO monolayers. Finally, the carrier mobilities of monolayer InXO (X=Se and Te) are obtained, which shows a rather pronounced anisotropy between electron and hole, and are almost isotropic between armchair and zigzag directions. Our works imply that it is possible to use the piezotronic effect to control the quantum transport process, ultimately leading to novel device applications in monolayer InXO (X=Se and Te), and can stimulate further experimental works.

In this work we propose an AI-powered pipeline, based on the deep-learning paradigm, for automated COVID-19 detection and lesion categorization from CT scans. We first propose a new segmentation module aimed at identifying automatically lung parenchyma and lobes. Next, we combined such segmentation network with classification networks for COVID-19 identification and lesion categorization. We compare the obtained classification results with those obtained by three expert radiologists on a dataset consisting of 162 CT scans. Results showed a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 93.5% for COVID-19 detection, outperforming those yielded by the expert radiologists, and an average lesion categorization accuracy of over 84%. Results also show that a significant role is played by prior lung and lobe segmentation that allowed us to enhance performance by over 20 percent points. The interpretation of the trained AI models, moreover, reveals that the most significant areas for supporting the decision on COVID-19 identification are consistent with the lesions clinically associated to the virus, i.e., crazy paving, consolidation and ground glass. This means that the artificial models are able to discriminate a positive patient from a negative one (both controls and patients with interstitial pneumonia tested negative to COVID) by evaluating the presence of those lesions into CT scans. Finally, the AI models are integrated into a user-friendly GUI to support AI explainability for radiologists, which is publicly available athttp://perceivelab.com/covid-ai. The whole AI system is unique since, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first AI-based software, publicly available, that attempts to explain to radiologists what information is used by AI methods for making decision and that involves proactively them in the decision loop to further improve the COVID-19 understanding.

Dividing the galaxies by their present-day stellar mass, we demonstrate the downsizing phenomenon, whereby the more massive galaxies hosted the most star-formation at earlier times. Further dividing the galaxy sample by colour and morphology, we find that a galaxy’s present-day colour tell us more about its historical contribution to the cosmic star formation history than its current morphology. We show that downsizing effects are greatest among galaxies currently in the blue cloud, but that the level of downsizing in galaxies of different morphologies depends quite sensitively on the morphological classification used, due largely to the difficulty in classifying the smaller low-mass galaxies from their ground-based images. Nevertheless, we find agreement that among galaxies with stellar masses, downsizing is most significant in spirals. However, there are complicating factors. For example, for more massive galaxies, we find that colour and morphology are predictors of the past star formation over a longer timescale than in less massive systems. Presumably this effect is reflecting the longer period of evolution required to alter these larger galaxies’ physical properties, but shows that conclusions based on any single property don’t tell the full story.	galaxies: evolution

For such a narrow-gap system, the thermal excitation from the valence band to the conduction band contributes to its TE properties even at the room temperature. In this study, the N-impurity bands are treated with both conduction and valence bands taken into account self-consistently. We found the optimal N concentration per unit cell,, which gives the maximum power factor () for various temperatures, e.g.,0.30withat 300K. In addition, the electronic thermal conductivity has been estimated, which turn out to be much smaller than the phonon thermal conductivity, leading to the figure of merit asfor N-substituted (20,0) SWCNTs withat 300K.

In this paper, we propose a novel regression loss based on Gaussian Wasserstein distance as a fundamental approach to solve the problem. Specifically, the rotated bounding box is converted to a 2-D Gaussian distribution, which enables to approximate the indifferentiable rotational IoU induced loss by the Gaussian Wasserstein distance (GWD) which can be learned efficiently by gradient back-propagation. GWD can still be informative for learning even there is no overlapping between two rotating bounding boxes which is often the case for small object detection. Thanks to its three unique properties, GWD can also elegantly solve the boundary discontinuity and square-like problem regardless how the bounding box is defined. Experiments on five datasets using different detectors show the effectiveness of our approach.

[2101.11959] Syntactic Nuclei in Dependency Parsing – A Multilingual Exploration	Ali BasiratUppsala UniversityDept. of Linguistics and  NivreUppsala UniversityDept. of Linguistics and		joakim.nivre@lingfil.uu.se ali.basirat@lingfil.uu.se	Standard models for syntactic dependency parsing take words to be the elementary units that enter into dependency relations. In this paper, we investigate whether there are any benefits from enriching these models with the more abstract notion of nucleus proposed by Tesnière. We do this by showing how the concept of nucleus can be defined in the framework of Universal Dependencies and how we can use composition functions to make a transition-based dependency parser aware of this concept. Experiments on 12 languages show that nucleus composition gives small but significant improvements in parsing accuracy. Further analysis reveals that the improvement mainly concerns a small number of dependency relations, including nominal modifiers, relations of coordination, main predicates, and direct objects.

A data sample of proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy ofrecorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider between 2015 and 2018 is used. The data correspond to a total integrated luminosity of. The search is guided by a type-II seesaw model that extends the scalar sector of the Standard Model with a scalar triplet, leading to a phenomenology that includes doubly and singly charged Higgs bosons. Two scenarios are explored, corresponding to the pair production of doubly chargedbosons, or the associated production of a doubly chargedboson and a singly chargedboson. No significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions are observed.bosons are excluded at 95% confidence level up toandfor the pair and associated production modes, respectively.\AtlasRefCodeHDBS-2019-06\AtlasJournalRefJHEP 06 (2021) 146\AtlasDOI10.1007/JHEP06(2021)146\PreprintIdNumberCERN-EP-2020-240

[2101.11963] On the computation of recurrence coefficients for univariate orthogonal polynomials	Zexin Liu Akil Narayan	Department of Mathematics and Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute the University of	akil@sci.utah.edu 20akil@sci.utah.edu zexin@math.utah.edu	Associated to a finite measure on the real line with finite moments are recurrence coefficients in a three-term formula for orthogonal polynomials with respect to this measure. These recurrence coefficients are frequently inputs to modern computational tools that facilitate evaluation and manipulation of polynomials with respect to the measure, and such tasks are foundational in numerical approximation and quadrature. Although the recurrence coefficients for classical measures are known explicitly, those for nonclassical measures must typically be numerically computed. We survey and review existing approaches for computing these recurrence coefficients for univariate orthogonal polynomial families and propose a novel “predictor-corrector” algorithm for a general class of continuous measures. We combine the predictor-corrector scheme with a stabilized Lanczos procedure for a new hybrid algorithm that computes recurrence coefficients for a fairly wide class of measures that can have both continuous and discrete parts. We evaluate the new algorithms against existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.	Keywords.

I	Central Institute of Economics and Mathematics of the RAS 47 Nakhimovskii Prospect 117418 Moscow Russia. e-mail:	vdanilov43@mail.ru	In the paper we study choice functions on posets satisfying the conditions of heredity and outcast. For every well-ordered sequence of elements of a poset, we define the corresponding ‘elementary’ choice function. Every such a choice function satisfies the conditions of heredity and outcast. Inversely, every choice function satisfying the conditions of heredity and outcast can be represented as a union of several elementary choice functions. This result generalizes the Aizerman-Malishevski theorem about the structure of path-independent choice functions.

The independent-electron susceptibility is constructed in a time representation over a non-uniform distribution of real-space locationsoptimized within a separable resolution-of-the-identity framework to reproduce standard Coulomb-fitting calculations with meV accuracy. The compactness of the obtaineddistribution leads to a crossover with the standard Coulomb-fitting scheme for system sizes below a few hundred electrons. The needed analytic continuation follows a recent approach that requires the continuation of the screened Coulomb potential rather than the much more structured self-energy. The present scheme is benchmarked over large molecular sets and scaling properties are demonstrated on a family of defected hexagonal boron-nitride flakes containing up to 6000 electrons.

Our proof is based on relating this question to the problem of the best linear estimation in continuous time one-parameter regression models with a stationary error process defined by the kernel. In particular, we show that the existence of a sequence of estimators with variances converging toimplies that the regression function cannot be an element of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This question is then related to the determinacy of the Hamburger moment problem for the spectral measure corresponding to the kernel.	
[2101.11969] Magnetic Field Effects on the Transport Properties of High-Tc Cuprates	E. C. Marino R. Arouca	thanks:	arouca@pos.if.ufrj.br marino@if.ufrj.br	Starting from a recently proposed comprehensive theory for the high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates, we derive a general analytic expression for the planar resistivity, in the presence of an applied external magnetic fieldHand explore its consequences in the different phases of these materials. As an initial probe of our result, we show it compares very well with experimental data for the resistivity of LSCO at different values of the applied field. We also apply our result to Bi2201 and show that the magnetoresistivity in the strange metal phase of this material, exhibits thetocrossover, as we move from the weak to the strong field regime. Yet, despite of that, the magnetoresistivity does not present a quadrature scaling. Remarkably, the resistivity H-field derivative does scale as a function of, in complete agreement with recent magneto-transport measurements made in the strange metal phase of cupratesAyres et al. (2020). We, finally, address the issue of the-power-law dependence of the resistivity of overdoped cuprates and compare our results with experimental data for Tl2201. We show that this provides a simple method to determine whether the quantum critical point associated to the pseudogap temperaturebelongs to the SC dome or not.

With the development of automated machine learning, agricultural experts are now able to train, evaluate and make predictions using cutting edge machine learning (ML) models without the need for much ML knowledge. Although this automated approach has led to successful results in many scenarios, in certain cases (e.g., when few labeled datasets are available) choosing among different models with similar performance metrics is a difficult task. Furthermore, these systems do not commonly allow users to incorporate their domain knowledge that could facilitate the task of model selection, and to gain insight into the prediction system for eventual decision making. To address these issues, in this paper we present AHMoSe, a visual support system that allows domain experts to better understand, diagnose and compare different regression models, primarily by enriching model-agnostic explanations with domain knowledge. To validate AHMoSe, we describe a use case scenario in the viticulture domain, grape quality prediction, where the system enables users to diagnose and select prediction models that perform better. We also discuss feedback concerning the design of the tool from both ML and viticulture experts.	Decision Support System | Visual Analytics | Explainable AI | Automated Machine Learning

We introduced the concept of complete subnets and the net graph representation. PSpan transforms Petri nets in net graphs and performs sub-net graph mining on them, then transforms the results back to frequent subnets. PSpan follows the pattern growth approach and has similar complexity like gSpan in graph mining. Experiments have been done to confirm PSpan’s reliability and complexity. Besides C/E nets, it applies also to a set of other Petri net subclasses.	Petri net mining | frequent subnet mining | PSpan algorithm | net graph | complete subnet | gSpan algorithm | DFS code

[2101.11974] Disembodied Machine Learning: On the Illusion of Objectivity in NLP	Zeerak Waseem Smarika Lulz Joachim Bingel Isabelle Augenstein	University of Sheffield		Machine Learning seeks to identify and encode bodies of knowledge within provided datasets. However, data encodes subjective content, which determines the possible outcomes of the models trained on it. Because such subjectivity enables marginalisation of parts of society, it is termed (social) ‘bias’ and sought to be removed. In this paper, we contextualise this discourse of bias in the ML community against the subjective choices in the development process. Through a consideration of how choices in data and model development construct subjectivity, or biases that are represented in a model, we argue that addressing and mitigating biases is near-impossible. This is because both data and ML models are objects for which meaning is made in each step of the development pipeline, from data selection over annotation to model training and analysis. Accordingly, we find the prevalent discourse of bias limiting in its ability to address social marginalisation. We recommend to be conscientious of this, and to accept that de-biasing methods only correct for a fraction of biases.

Proposed mission plans involve a10 year cruise time to the ice giants. This cruise time can be utilized to search for low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) by observing the Doppler shift caused by them in the Earth–spacecraft radio link. We calculate the sensitivity of prospective ice giant missions to GWs. Then, adopting a steady-state black hole binary population, we derive a conservative estimate for the detection rate of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), supermassive– (SMBH) and stellar mass binary black hole (sBBH) mergers. We link the SMBH population to the fraction of quasarsresulting from galaxy mergers that pair SMBHs to a binary. For a total of ten 40-day observations during the cruise of a single spacecraft,detections of SMBH mergers are likely, if Allan deviation of Cassini-era noise is improved byin theHz range. For EMRIs the number of detections lies between. Furthermore, ice giant missions combined with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) would improve the localisation by an order of magnitude compared to LISA by itself.	gravitational waves – planets and satellites: individual: Uranus – planets and satellites: individual: Neptune – quasars: supermassive black holes – black hole mergers

Elena Zotova Rodrigo Agerri German Rigau	group at Vicomtech Foundation Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA)	ezotova@vicomtech.org rodrigo.agerri@ehu.eus german.rigau@ehu.eus	Popular social media networks provide the perfect environment to study the opinions and attitudes expressed by users. While interactions in social media such as Twitter occur in many natural languages, research on stance detection (the position or attitude expressed with respect to a specific topic) within the Natural Language Processing field has largely been done for English. Although some efforts have recently been made to develop annotated data in other languages, there is a telling lack of resources to facilitate multilingual and crosslingual research on stance detection. This is partially due to the fact that manually annotating a corpus of social media texts is a difficult, slow and costly process. Furthermore, as stance is a highly domain- and topic-specific phenomenon, the need for annotated data is specially demanding. As a result, most of the manually labeled resources are hindered by their relatively small size and skewed class distribution. This paper presents a method to obtain multilingual datasets for stance detection in Twitter. Instead of manually annotating on a per tweet basis, we leverage user-based information to semi-automatically label large amounts of tweets. Empirical monolingual and cross-lingual experimentation and qualitative analysis show that our method helps to overcome the aforementioned difficulties to build large, balanced and multilingual labeled corpora. We believe that our method can be easily adapted to easily generate labeled social media data for other Natural Language Processing tasks and domains.

[2101.11981] Embedding Symbolic Temporal Knowledge into Deep Sequential Models	Yaqi Xie, Fan Zhou, and Harold SohDept. of Computer Science, National University of Singapore.{yaqixie, zhoufan	Equal Contribution.		Sequences and time-series often arise in robot tasks, e.g., in activity recognition and imitation learning. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as an effective data-driven methodology for processing sequences given sufficient training data and compute resources. However, when data is limited, simpler models such as logic/rule-based methods work surprisingly well, especially when relevant prior knowledge is applied in their construction. However, unlike DNNs, these “structured” models can be difficult to extend, and do not work well with raw unstructured data. In this work, we seek to learn flexible DNNs, yet leverage prior temporal knowledge when available. Our approach is to embed symbolic knowledge expressed as linear temporal logic (LTL) and use these embeddings to guide the training of deep models. Specifically, we construct semantic-based embeddings of automata generated from LTL formula via a Graph Neural Network. Experiments show that these learnt embeddings can lead to improvements on downstream robot tasks such as sequential action recognition and imitation learning.

Radu Christoph Adelmann Florin Ciubotaru	Imec B-3001 Leuven BelgiumKU Leuven Departement Materiaalkunde 3001 Leuven Belgium	Florin.Ciubotaru@imec.be	Spin waves modes in magnetic waveguides with width down to 320 nm have been studied by electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy and micromagnetic simulations for both longitudinal and transverse magnetic bias fields. For longitudinal bias fields, a 1.3 GHz wide spin-wave band was observed in agreement with analytical dispersion relations for uniform magnetization. However, transverse bias field led to several distinct bands, corresponding to different quantized width modes, with both negative and positive slopes. Micromagnetic simulations showed that, in this geometry, the magnetization was nonuniform and tilted due to the strong shape anisotropy of the waveguides. Simulations of the quantized spin-wave modes in such nonuniformly magnetized waveguides resulted in spin wave dispersion relations in good agreement with the experiments.

We approach this problem by first considering the mold modeling problem (direct problem). Then, we plant the heat flux estimation problem as the inverse problem of estimating a Neumann boundary condition having as data pointwise temperature measurements in the interior of the mold domain. We also consider the case of having a total heat flux measurement together with the temperature measurements. We develop two methodologies for solving this inverse problem. The first one is the traditional Alifanov’s regularization, the second one exploits the parameterization of the heat flux. We develop the latter method to have an offline-online decomposition with a computationally efficient online part to be performed in real-time. In the last part of this work, we test these methods on academic and industrial benchmarks. The results show that the parameterization method outclasses Alifanov’s regularization both in performance and computational cost. Moreover, it proves to be robust with respect to the measurements noise. Finally, the tests confirm that the computational cost is suitable for real-time estimation of the heat flux.

Tay1, Jiashi Feng1, Shuicheng Yan1National University of SingaporeYITU TechnologyInstitute of Data Science, National University of	Work done during an internship at Yitu Tech.	yunpeng.chen@yitu-inc.com shuicheng.yan@gmail.com yuanli@u.nus.edu	Transformers, which are popular for language modeling, have been explored for solving vision tasks recently,e.g., the Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification. The ViT model splits each image into a sequence of tokens with fixed length and then applies multiple Transformer layers to model their global relation for classification. However, ViT achieves inferior performance to CNNs when trained from scratch on a midsize dataset like ImageNet. We find it is because: 1) the simple tokenization of input images fails to model the important local structure such as edges and lines among neighboring pixels, leading to low training sample efficiency; 2) the redundant attention backbone design of ViT leads to limited feature richness for fixed computation budgets and limited training samples. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new Tokens-To-Token Vision Transformer (T2T-ViT), which incorporates 1) a layer-wise Tokens-to-Token (T2T) transformation to progressively structurize the image to tokens by recursively aggregating neighboring Tokens into one Token (Tokens-to-Token), such that local structure represented by surrounding tokens can be modeled and tokens length can be reduced; 2) an efficient backbone with a deep-narrow structure for vision transformer motivated by CNN architecture design after empirical study. Notably, T2T-ViT reduces the parameter count and MACs of vanilla ViT by half, while achieving more than 3.0% improvement when trained from scratch on ImageNet. It also outperforms ResNets and achieves comparable performance with MobileNets by directly training on ImageNet. For example, T2T-ViT with comparable size to ResNet50 (21.5M parameters) can achieve 83.3% top1 accuracy in image resolution 384384 on ImageNet.111Code: https://github.com/yitu-opensource/T2T-ViT	
[2101.11987] PIG-Net: Inception based Deep Learning Architecture for 3D Point Cloud Segmentation	SindhuHegde ShankarGangisetty		sindhu.hegde@research.iiit.ac.in shankar@kletech.ac	Point clouds, being the simple and compact representation of surface geometry of 3D objects, have gained increasing popularity with the evolution of deep learning networks for classification and segmentation tasks. Unlike human, teaching the machine to analyze the segments of an object is a challenging task and quite essential in various machine vision applications. In this paper, we address the problem of segmentation and labelling of the 3D point clouds by proposing a inception based deep network architecture called PIG-Net, that effectively characterizes the local and global geometric details of the point clouds. In PIG-Net, the local features are extracted from the transformed input points using the proposed inception layers and then aligned by feature transform. These local features are aggregated using the global average pooling layer to obtain the global features. Finally, feed the concatenated local and global features to the convolution layers for segmenting the 3D point clouds. We perform an exhaustive experimental analysis of the PIG-Net architecture on two state-of-the-art datasets, namely, ShapeNetYi et al. (2016)and PartNetMo et al. (2019). We evaluate the effectiveness of our network by performing ablation study.	\KWDPoint cloud segmentation | Inception module | Global average pooling | PointNet | ShapeNet | PartNet | MLP

Using HAXPES we confirm that all the cations retain their nominal valence state throughout the series. The asymmetric nature of Bi core-level spectra for compositions in the metallic region indicates that Bi contributes to the density of states at the Fermi energy in this doping range. The valence band spectra show that the Bipeak is unaltered throughout the series and is situated deep within the valence band. Instead, we argue that Bi–Irhybridisation drives the insulator-to-metal transition.

The constraint of the seroprevalence parameter induced from the known confirmed cornonavirus 2019 cases can be imposed naturally in the proposed Bayesian model. We also prove that the confidence interval of the seroprevalence parameter based on the Rao’s test can be the empty set, while the Bayesian method renders a reasonable interval estimator. As of theth of October 2020, thecredible interval of the estimated SARS-CoV-2 positive population does not exceed, approximatelyof the Korean population.	
[2101.11992] Acting in Delayed Environments with Non-Stationary Markov Policies	Esther  Dalal11footnotemark:1Nvidia  MannorNvidia Research &	footnotemark:	shie@ee.technion.ac.il gdalal@nvidia.com estherderman@campus.technion.ac.il	The standard Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation hinges on the assumption that an action is executed immediately after it was chosen. However, assuming it is often unrealistic and can lead to catastrophic failures in applications such as robotic manipulation, cloud computing, and finance. We introduce a framework for learning and planning in MDPs where the decision-maker commits actions that are executed with a delay ofsteps. The brute-force state augmentation baseline where the state is concatenated to the lastcommitted actions suffers from an exponential complexity in, as we show for policy iteration. We then prove that with execution delay, deterministic Markov policies in the original state-space are sufficient for attaining maximal reward, but need to be non-stationary. As for stationary Markov policies, we show they are sub-optimal in general. Consequently, we devise a non-stationary Q-learning style model-based algorithm that solves delayed execution tasks without resorting to state-augmentation. Experiments on tabular, physical, and Atari domains reveal that it converges quickly to high performance even for substantial delays, while standard approaches that either ignore the delay or rely on state-augmentation struggle or fail due to divergence. The code is available athttps://github.com/galdl/rl_delay_basic.git.

Tuinier	Laboratory of Physical Chemistry Department of Chemical Engineering and Chemistry & Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS) Eindhoven University of Technology P.O. Box 513 5600 MB Eindhoven The Netherlands	r.tuinier@tue.nl	Comprehensive calculations were performed to predict the phase behaviour of large spherical colloids mixed with small spherical colloids that act as depletant. To this end, the free volume theory (FVT) of Lekkerkerkeret al.[Europhys. Lett.20(1992) 559] is used as a basis and is extended to explicitly include the hard-sphere character of colloidal depletants into the expression for the free volume fraction. Taking the excluded volume of the depletants into account inthe system and the reservoir provides a relation between the depletant concentration in the reservoir and in the system that accurately matches with computer simulation results of Dijkstraet al.[Phys. Rev. E59(1999) 5744]. Moreover, the phase diagrams for highly asymmetric mixtures with size ratiosobtained by using this new approach corroborates simulation results significantly better than earlier FVT applications to binary hard-sphere mixtures. The phase diagram of a binary hard-sphere mixture with a size ratio of, where a binary interstitial solid solution is formed at high densities, is investigated using a numerical free volume approach. At this size ratio, the obtained phase diagram is qualitatively different from previous FVT approaches for hard-sphere and penetrable depletants, but again compares well with simulation predictions.

Fleischhauer	Department of Physics and Research Center OPTIMAS University of Kaiserslautern 67663 Kaiserslautern Germany		Bose polarons, quasi-particles composed of mobile impurities surrounded by cold Bose gas, can experience strong interactions mediated by the many-body environment and form bipolaron bound states. Here we present a detailed study of heavy polarons in a one-dimensional Bose gas by formulating a non-perturbative theory and complementing it with exact numerical simulations. We develop an analytic approach for weak boson-boson interactions and arbitrarily strong impurity-boson couplings. Our approach is based on a mean-field theory that accounts for deformations of the superfluid by the impurities and in this way minimizes quantum fluctuations. The mean-field equations are solved exactly in Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation leading to an analytic expression for the interaction potential of heavy polarons which is found to be in excellent agreement with quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) results. In the strong-coupling limit the potential substantially deviates from the exponential form valid for weak coupling and has a linear shape at short distances. Taking into account the leading-order Born-Huang corrections we calculate bipolaron binding energies for impurity-boson mass ratios as low as 3 and find excellent agreement with QMC results.

This paper focuses on the problem of providing valid (i.e., frequency calibrated) multi-variate predictions. To do so, we propose to use copula functions applied to deep neural networks for inductive conformal prediction. We show that the proposed method ensures efficiency and validity for multi-target regression problems on various data sets.

Accordingly, different particle tracking methods for various scenarios have been developed. In this article, we present a particle tracking application implemented in Python for, in particular, spherical magnetic particles, including superparamagnetic beads and Janus particles. In the following, we distinguish between two sub-steps in particle tracking, namely the localization of particles in single images and the linking of the extracted particle positions of the subsequent frames into trajectories. We provide an intensity-based localization technique to detect particles and two linking algorithms, which apply either frame-by-frame linking or linear assignment problem solving. Beyond that, we offer helpful tools to preprocess images automatically as well as estimate parameters required for the localization algorithm by utilizing machine learning. As an extra, we have implemented a technique to estimate the current spatial orientation of Janus particles within the x-y-plane. Our framework is readily extendable and easy-to-use as we offer a graphical user interface and a command-line tool. Various output options, such as data frames and videos, ensure further analysis that can be automated.

[2101.12009] A Peculiar ICME Event in August 2018 Observed with the Global Muon Detector Network			Kihara19ss204g@shinshu-u.ac.jp	We demonstrate that global observations of high-energy cosmic rays contribute to understanding unique characteristics of a large-scale magnetic flux rope causing a magnetic storm in August 2018. Following a weak interplanetary shock on 25 August 2018, a magnetic flux rope caused an unexpectedly large geomagnetic storm. It is likely that this event became geoeffective because the flux rope was accompanied by a corotating interaction region and compressed by high-speed solar wind following the flux rope. In fact, a Forbush decrease was observed in cosmic-ray data inside the flux rope as expected, and a significant cosmic-ray density increase exceeding the unmodulated level before the shock was also observed near the trailing edge of the flux rope. The cosmic-ray density increase can be interpreted in terms of the adiabatic heating of cosmic rays near the trailing edge of the flux rope, as the corotating interaction region prevents free expansion of the flux rope and results in the compression near the trailing edge. A northeast-directed spatial gradient in the cosmic-ray density was also derived during the cosmic-ray density increase, suggesting that the center of the heating near the trailing edge is located northeast of Earth. This is one of the best examples demonstrating that the observation of high-energy cosmic rays provides us with information that can only be derived from the cosmic ray measurements to observationally constrain the three-dimensional macroscopic picture of the interaction between coronal mass ejections and the ambient solar wind, which is essential for prediction of large magnetic storms.

E-mail: Manuscript received xx xx 202x; revised xx xx 202x.	atung@comp.nus.edu.sg	Deep neural networks are being increasingly used for short-term traffic flow prediction, which can be generally categorized as convolutional (CNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs). CNNs are preferable for region-wise traffic prediction by taking advantage of localized spatial correlations, whilst GNNs achieves better performance for graph-structured traffic data. When applied to region-wise traffic prediction, CNNs typically partition an underlying territory into grid-like spatial units, and employ standard convolutions to learn spatial dependence among the units. However, standard convolutions with fixed geometric structures cannot fully model the nonstationary characteristics of local traffic flows. To overcome the deficiency, we introduce deformable convolution that augments the spatial sampling locations with additional offsets, to enhance the modeling capability of spatial nonstationarity. On this basis, we design a deep deformable convolutional residual network, namelyDeFlow-Net, that can effectively model global spatial dependence, local spatial nonstationarity, and temporal periodicity of traffic flows. Furthermore, to better fit with convolutions, we suggest to first aggregate traffic flows according to pre-conceived regions or self-organized regions based on traffic flows, then dispose to sequentially organized raster images for network input. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic flows demonstrate thatDeFlow-Netoutperforms GNNs and existing CNNs using standard convolutions, and spatial partition by pre-conceived regions or self-organized regions further enhances the performance. We also demonstrate the advantage ofDeFlow-Netin maintaining spatial autocorrelation, and reveal the impacts of partition shapes and scales on deep traffic flow prediction.

Gaithersburg, MD 208991Email:		peter.bajcsy@nist.gov	This paper addresses the problem of detecting trojans in neural networks (NNs) by analyzing systematically pruned NN models. Our pruning-based approach consists of three main steps. First, detect any deviations from the reference look-up tables of model file sizes and model graphs. Next, measure the accuracy of a set of systematically pruned NN models following multiple pruning schemas. Finally, classify a NN model as clean or poisoned by applying a mapping between accuracy measurements and NN model labels. This work outlines a theoretical and experimental framework for finding the optimal mapping over a large search space of pruning parameters. Based on our experiments using Round 1 and Round 2 TrojAI Challenge datasets, the approach achieves average classification accuracy ofandrespectively with an average processing time of less thanper model.

Due to the differences in the propagation conditions, wireless aerial channels’ features differ from those of terrestrial wireless channels; therefore, unmanned aerial vehicle path loss models are often different from conventional terrestrial wireless channel path loss models. A mathematical propagation model is proposed in this paper to estimate the Ground-to-Air path loss between a wireless device and a low-altitude platform using the frequency bands of the millimeter wave. The suggested model of Ground-to-Air path loss will assist academic researchers in formulating several vital problems.Keywords:Wireless Propagation; Ground-to-Air Path Loss Model; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV); Millimeter Wave Radio (mmWave); Suburban Environment; Urban Environment; Dense Urban Environment; High-rise Urban Environment

[2101.12026] Optimal transportation of grain boundaries: A forward model for predicting migration mechanisms	Ian Chesser Elizabeth Holm Brandon Runnels		eaholm@andrew.cmu.edu brunnels@uccs.edu ichesser@andrew.cmu.edu	It has been hypothesized that the most likely atomic rearrangement mechanism during grain boundary (GB) migration is the one that minimizes the lengths of atomic displacements in the dichromatic pattern. In this work, we recast the problem of atomic displacement minimization during GB migration as an optimal transport (OT) problem. Under the assumption of a small potential energy barrier for atomic rearrangement, the principle of stationary action applied to GB migration is reduced to the determination of the Wasserstein metric for two point sets. In order to test the minimum distance hypothesis, optimal displacement patterns predicted on the basis of a regularized OT based forward model are compared to molecular dynamics (MD) GB migration data for a variety of GB types and temperatures. Limits of applicability of the minimum distance hypothesis and interesting consequences of the OT formulation are discussed in the context of MD data analysis for twist GBs, generaltwin boundaries and a tilt GB that exhibits shear coupling. The forward model may be used to predict atomic displacement patterns for arbitrary disconnection modes and a variety of metastable states, facilitating the analysis of multimodal GB migration data.

The set of-dimensional intervals is denoted by. This paper aims to investigate semi-vector spaces over a weak semifield and aggregation functions concerning an admissible order on the set of-dimensional intervals and the construction of aggregation functions onbased on the operations of the semi-vector spaces. In particular, extensions of the family of OWA and weighted average aggregation functions are investigated. Finally, we develop a multi-criteria group decision-making method based on-dimensional aggregation functions with respect to an admissible order and give an illustrative example.	
[2101.12031] Robust Android Malware Detection System against Adversarial Attacks using Q-Learning	Hemant Rathore, Sanjay K. Sahay, Piyush NikamBITS Pilani, Department of CS & IS, Goa Campus{hemantr, ssahay,  Mohit SewakSecurity & Compliance Research, Microsoft,		mohit.sewak@microsoft.com	Since the inception of Android OS, smartphones sales have been growing exponentially, and today it enjoys the monopoly in the smartphone marketplace. The widespread adoption of Android smartphones has drawn the attention of malware designers, which threatens the Android ecosystem. The current state-of-the-art Android malware detection systems are based on machine learning and deep learning models. Despite having superior performance, these models are susceptible to adversarial attack. Therefore in this paper, we developed eight Android malware detection models based on machine learning and deep neural network and investigated their robustness against the adversarial attacks. For the purpose, we created new variants of malware using Reinforcement Learning, which will be misclassified as benign by the existing Android malware detection models. We propose two novel attack strategies, namely single policy attack and multiple policy attack using reinforcement learning for white-box and grey-box scenario respectively. Putting ourselves in adversary’ shoes, we designed adversarial attacks on the detection models with the goal of maximising fooling rate, while making minimum modifications to the Android application and ensuring that the app’s functionality and behaviour does not change. We achieved an average fooling rate ofandacross all the eight detection models with maximum five modifications using a single policy attack and multiple policy attack, respectively. The highest fooling rate ofwith five changes was attained against the decision tree based model using the multiple policy approach. Finally, we propose an adversarial defence strategy which reduces the average fooling rate by threefold toagainst a single policy attack, thereby increasing the robustness of the detection models i.e. the proposed model can effectively detect variants (metamorphic) of malware. The experimental analysis shows that our proposed Android malware detection system using reinforcement learning is more robust against adversarial attacks.

Müller	Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information Austrian Academy of Sciences Boltzmanngasse 3 A-1090 Vienna AustriaVienna Center for Quantum Science and Technology (VCQ) Faculty of Physics University of Vienna Vienna Austria		If our actions are determined by the laws of nature, can we meaningfully claim to possess free will? Compatibilists argue that the answer is yes, and that free will is compatible with complete determinism. Previously, it has been suggested that the notion of computational irreducibility can shed light on this relation: it implies that there cannot in general be “shortcuts” to the decisions of agents, explaining why deterministic agents often appear to have free will. In this paper, we introduce a variant of computational irreducibility that intends to capture more accurately aspects of actual (as opposed to apparent) free will: computational sourcehood, i.e. the phenomenon that the successful prediction of a process’ outputs must typically involve an almost-exact representation of the relevant features of that process, regardless of the time it takes to arrive at the prediction. We conjecture that many processes have this property, and we study different possibilities for how to formalize this conjecture in terms of universal Turing machines. While we are not able to settle the conjecture, we give several results and constructions that shed light on the quest for its correct formulation.	
[2101.12034] Ellipse Combining with Unknown Cross Ellipse Correlations	Adam Hall			We discuss the combining of measurements where single measurement covariances are given but the joint measurement covariance is unknown. For this paper we assume the mapping of a single measurement to the solution space is the identity matrix. We examine the solution when it is assumed all measurements are uncorrelated. We then present a way to parameter joint measurement covariance based on pairwise correlation coefficients. Finally, we discuss how to use this parameterization to combine the measurements.

Jucá Régis Varão	Instituto de Matemática e Estatística IME-UFG Goiânia-GO 	joabyjuca@discente.ufg.com varao@unicamp.br euzebio@ufg.br	It is well known that smooth (or continuous) vector fields cannot be topologically transitive on the sphere. Piecewise-smooth vector fields, on the other hand, may present non-trivial recurrence even on. Accordingly, in this paper the existence of topologically transitive piecewise-smooth vector fields onis proved, see TheoremA. We also prove that transitivity occurs alongside the presence of some particular portions of the phase portrait known assliding regionandescaping region. More precisely, TheoremBstates that, under the presence of transitivity, trajectories must interchange between sliding and escaping regions through tangency points. In addition, we prove that every transitive piecewise-smooth vector field is neither robustly transitive nor structural stable on, see TheoremC. We finish the paper proving TheoremDaddressing non-robustness on general compact two-dimensional manifolds.

[2101.12037] BENDR: using transformers and a contrastive self-supervised learning task to learn from massive amounts of EEG data.	Demetres KostasUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, CanadaVector Institute, Toronto,  Aroca-OuelletteUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, CanadaVector Institute, Toronto, Canada&Frank RudziczUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, CanadaVector Institute, Toronto, CanadaLi Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, Toronto, Canada		demetres@cs.toronto.edu	Deep neural networks (DNNs) used for brain-computer-interface (BCI) classification are commonly expected to learn general features when trained across a variety of contexts, such that these features could be fine-tuned to specific contexts. While some success is found in such an approach, we suggest that this interpretation is limited and an alternative would better leverage the newly (publicly) available massive EEG datasets. We consider how to adapt techniques and architectures used for language modelling (LM), that appear capable of ingesting awesome amounts of data, towards the development of encephalography modelling (EM) with DNNs in the same vein. We specifically adapt an approach effectively used for automatic speech recognition, which similarly (to LMs) uses a self-supervised training objective to learn compressed representations of raw data signals. After adaptation to EEG, we find that a single pre-trained model is capable of modelling completely novel raw EEG sequences recorded with differing hardware, and different subjects performing different tasks. Furthermore, both the internal representations of this model and the entire architecture can be fine-tuned to avarietyof downstream BCI and EEG classification tasks, outperforming prior work in moretask-specific(sleep stage classification) self-supervision.

We also show that such a small nonlinear correction of the Reissner–Nordström black holes has high effects on the phase structure of the solutions. It leads to a new classification in the canonical ensemble of extended phase space providing the values of the nonlinearity parameterbeing. We shall study these three classes and investigate deviations from those of the standard Reissner–Nordström solutions. Interestingly, we find that there is the reentrant phase transition for, and for the case ofthere is no phase transition below (at) the critical point. For the last case, one finds that small and large black holes are thermodynamically distinguishable for temperatures and pressures higher than the critical ones.

The system considered in this paper is different from those considered in the existing literature, which fully considers the matching time between passengers and taxis, and the taxi capacity of the system. The objective is to get the equilibrium joining strategy and the socially optimal strategy under two information levels. For the practical consideration of the airport terminal scenario, two different information levels are considered. The theoretical results show that the passenger utility function in the partially observable case is monotonic. For the complex form of social welfare function of the partially observable case, we use a split derivation. The equilibrium strategy and socially optimal strategy of the observable case are threshold-type. Furthermore, some representative numerical scenarios are used to visualize the theoretical results. The numerical scenarios illustrate the influence of parameters on the equilibrium strategy and socially optimal strategy under two information levels. Finally, the optimal social welfare for the two information levels with the same parameters are compared.

We model equilibria as a module over an Arrow and define an operator to build a new Arrow from such a module over an existing Arrow. We also model strategies as graded Arrows and define an operator which builds a new Arrow by taking the colimit of a graded Arrow. A final operator builds a graded Arrow from a graded bimodule. We use this compositional approach to CGT to show how known and previously unknown variants of open games can be proven to form symmetric monoidal categories.

[2101.12047] Measuring Intelligence and Growth Rate: Variations on Hibbard’s Intelligence Measure	\nameSamuel  Author)The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, New York Regional Office\AND\nameBill Hibbard\addrSpace Science and Engineering Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI		samuelallenalexander@gmail.com	In 2011, Hibbard suggested an intelligence measure for agents who compete in an adversarial sequence prediction game. We argue that Hibbard’s idea should actually be considered as two separate ideas: first, that the intelligence of such agents can be measured based on the growth rates of the runtimes of the competitors that they defeat; and second, one specific (somewhat arbitrary) method for measuring said growth rates. Whereas Hibbard’s intelligence measure is based on the latter growth-rate-measuring method, we survey other methods for measuring function growth rates, and exhibit the resulting Hibbard-like intelligence measures and taxonomies. Of particular interest, we obtain intelligence taxonomies based on Big-O and Big-Theta notation systems, which taxonomies are novel in that they challenge conventional notions of what an intelligence measure should look like. We discuss how intelligence measurement of sequence predictors can indirectly serve as intelligence measurement for agents with Artificial General Intelligence (AGIs).

The use of entangled sensors in quantum metrology improves the precision limit from the standard quantum limit (SQL) to the Heisenberg limit (HL) [?, ?]. To date, most experiments beating the SQL are performed on the sensors which are well isolated under extreme conditions [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]. However, it has not been realized in solid-state spin systems at ambient conditions, owing to its intrinsic complexity for the preparation and survival of pure and entangled quantum states. Here we show a full interferometer sequence beating the SQL by employing a hybrid multi-spin system, namely the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond. The interferometer sequence starts from a deterministic and joint initialization, undergoes entanglement and disentanglement of multiple spins, and ends up with projective measurement. In particular, the deterministic and joint initialization of NV negative state, NV electron spin, and two nuclear spins is realized at room temperature for the first time. By means of optimal control, non-local gates are implemented with an estimated fidelity above the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation. With these techniques combined, we achieve two-spin interference with a phase sensitivity of 1.79 ± 0.06 dB beyond the SQL and three-spin 2.77 ± 0.10 dB. Moreover, the deviations from the HL induced by experimental imperfections are completely accountable. The techniques used here are of fundamental importance for quantum sensing and computing [?, ?], and naturally applicable to other solid-state spin systems [?, ?, ?, ?].

Young moving groups allow to probe this population, since discs are expected to have been brighter early on. This paper considers the population of F stars in the 23 Myr-old BPMG where we find that 9/12 targets possess discs. We also analyse archival ALMA data to derive radii for 4 of the discs, presenting the first image of the 63au radius disc of HD 164249. Comparing the BPMG results to disc samples fromMyr andMyr-old moving groups, and to discs found around field stars, we find the disc incidence rate in young moving groups is comparable to that of the BPMG and significantly higher than that of field stars. The BPMG discs tend to be smaller than those around field stars. However, this difference is not statistically significant due to the small number of targets. Yet, by analysing the fractional luminosity vs disc radius parameter space we find that the fractional luminosities in the populations considered drop by two orders of magnitude within the first 100 Myr. This is much faster than expected by collisional evolution, implying a decay equivalent to. We attribute this depletion to embedded planets which would be around 170to cause a depletion on the appropriate timescale. However, we cannot rule out that different birth environments of nearby young clusters result in brighter debris discs than the progenitors of field stars which likely formed in a more dense environment.	infrared: planetary systems – planet-disc interactions – planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability
[2101.12050] VAE²: Preventing Posterior Collapse of Variational Video Predictions in the Wild	Yizhou Zhou,1Chong Luo,2Xiaoyan Sun,2Zheng-Jun Zha,1Wenjun Zeng21University of Science Technology of China2Microsoft Research   {xysun, cluo,		zhazj@ustc.edu.cn zyz0205@mail.ustc.edu.cn	Predicting future frames of video sequences is challenging due to the complex and stochastic nature of the problem. Video prediction methods based on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) have been a great success, but they require the training data to contain multiple possible futures for an observed video sequence. This is hard to be fulfilled when videos are captured in the wild where any given observation only has a determinate future. As a result, training a vanilla VAE model with these videos inevitably causes posterior collapse. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel VAE structure, dabbed VAE-in-VAE or VAE. The key idea is to explicitly introduce stochasticity into the VAE. We treat part of the observed video sequence as a random transition state that bridges its past and future, and maximize the likelihood of a Markov Chain over the video sequence under all possible transition states. A tractable lower bound is proposed for this intractable objective function and an end-to-end optimization algorithm is designed accordingly. VAEcan mitigate the posterior collapse problem to a large extent, as it breaks the direct dependence between future and observation and does not directly regress the determinate future provided by the training data. We carry out experiments on a large-scale dataset called Cityscapes, which contains videos collected from a number of urban cities. Results show that VAEis capable of predicting diverse futures and is more resistant to posterior collapse than the other state-of-the-art VAE-based approaches. We believe that VAEis also applicable to other stochastic sequence prediction problems where training data are lack of stochasticity.

This paper proposes a unit-modulus over-the-air computation (UMAirComp) framework to facilitate efficient edge federated learning, which simultaneously uploads local model parameters and updates global model parameters via analog beamforming. The proposed framework avoids sophisticated baseband signal processing, leading to low communication delays and implementation costs. Training loss bounds of UMAirComp FL systems are derived and two low-complexity large-scale optimization algorithms, termed penalty alternating minimization (PAM) and accelerated gradient projection (AGP), are proposed to minimize the nonconvex nonsmooth loss bound. Simulation results show that the proposed UMAirComp framework with PAM algorithm achieves a smaller mean square error of model parameters’ estimation, training loss, and test error compared with other benchmark schemes. Moreover, the proposed UMAirComp framework with AGP algorithm achieves satisfactory performance while reduces the computational complexity by orders of magnitude compared with existing optimization algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the implementation of UMAirComp in a vehicle-to-everything autonomous driving simulation platform. It is found that autonomous driving tasks are more sensitive to model parameter errors than other tasks since the neural networks for autonomous driving contain sparser model parameters.

We show that renormalized solutions of these systems are Lagrangian and that these notions of solution, in fact, coincide. As a consequence, finite-energy solutions are shown to be transported by a global flow. Moreover, we extend the notion of generalized solution for “effective” densities and we prove its existence. Finally, under a higher integrability assumption of the initial condition, we show that solutions have every energy bounded, even in the gravitational case. These results extend to our setting those obtained by Ambrosio, Colombo, and Figalli[vlasovpoisson]for the Vlasov-Poisson system; here, we analyse relativistic systems and we consider the contribution of the magnetic force into the evolution equation.

The so-called SD-(1+1) EA introduced by Rajabi and Witt (GECCO 2020) adds stagnation detection to the classical (1+1) EA with standard bit mutation, which flips each bit independently with some mutation rate, and raises the mutation rate when the algorithm is likely to have encountered local optima.	
[2101.12055] Influence of interaction softness in phase separation of active particles	Monika Sanoria Raghunath Chelakkot Amitabha Nandi		amitabha@phy.iitb.ac.in raghu@phy.iitb.ac.in	Using a minimal model of active Brownian discs, we study the effect of a crucial parameter, namely the softness of the inter-particle repulsion, on motility-induced phase separation. We show that an increase in particle softness reduces the ability of the system to phase-separate and the system exhibit a delayed transition. After phase separation, the system state properties can be explained by a single relevant lengthscale, the effective inter-particle distance. We estimate this lengthscale analytically and use it to rescale the state properties at dense phase for systems with different interaction softness. Using this lengthscale, we provide a scaling relation for the time taken to phase separate which shows a high sensitivity to the interaction softness.

Jansky Very Large Array at 1.4, 5.5, 9.0, and 14.0 GHz. Our sample is selected from ULIRGs whose active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are not found at optical wavelengths (70% of the entire ULIRGs), but whose presence is suggested by mid-infrared or submillimetre observations (% of the non-AGN ULIRGs at optical wavelengths). The statistical properties of the targets are similar to those of the entire ULIRG sample, which implies that ULIRGs have common radiative processes regardless of the presence of optical AGNs, and thus AGNs might equally contribute to the radio emission of every ULIRG. Although their spectra are mainly explained by starbursts and/or merger activity, some individual sources suggest contributions from AGNs. IRAS 001880856, whose optical morphology is not disturbed, shows a large nonthermal fraction and a spectral break at high frequency, which can be explained by synchrotron ageing of nonthermal plasma emitted from AGNs. In addition, we find 100-kpc scale extended emission associated with IRAS 010042237. The two-sided morphology and absence of extended X-ray emission suggest that this system is not induced by a merger in a cluster but originates from AGN activity.	galaxies: active — galaxies: nuclei — radio continuum: galaxies — techniques: interferometric
[2101.12059] Vx2Text: End-to-End Learning of Video-Based Text Generation From Multimodal Inputs	Xudong Lin Gedas Bertasius Jue Wang Shih-Fu Chang Devi Parikh Lorenzo TorresaniColumbia UniversityFacebook AIGeorgia TechDartmouth			We presentVx2Text, a framework for text generation from multimodal inputs consisting of video plus text, speech, or audio. In order to leverage transformer networks, which have been shown to be effective at modeling language, each modality is first converted into a set of language embeddings by a learnable tokenizer. This allows our approach to perform multimodal fusion in the language space, thus eliminating the need for ad-hoc cross-modal fusion modules. To address the non-differentiability of tokenization on continuous inputs (e.g., video or audio), we utilize a relaxation scheme that enables end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike prior encoder-only models, our network includes an autoregressive decoder to generate open-ended text from the multimodal embeddings fused by the language encoder. This renders our approach fully generative and makes it directly applicable to different “video+to text” problems without the need to design specialized network heads for each task. The proposed framework is not only conceptually simple but also remarkably effective: experiments demonstrate that our approach based on a single architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art on three video-based text-generation tasks—captioning, question answering and audio-visual scene-aware dialog.

We call it theboxed threshold arrangementsince we show that the bounded regions of this arrangement are contained in an-cube and are in one-to-one correspondence with the labeled threshold graphs onvertices. The problem of counting regions of this arrangement was studied earlier by Joungmin Song. He determined the characteristic polynomial of this arrangement by relating its coefficients to the count of certain graphs. Here, we provide bijective arguments to determine the number of regions. In particular, we construct certain signed partitions of the setand also construct colored threshold graphs onvertices and show that both these objects are in bijection with the regions of the boxed threshold arrangement. We independently count these objects and provide a closed form formula for the number of regions.	Key words and phrases:threshold graph | hyperplane arrangement | finite field method.

Partially ordered patterns (POPs) provide a convenient way to denote patterns in which the relative order of some of the letters does not matter. This paper elucidates connections between the avoidance sets of a few POPs with other combinatorial objects, directly answering five open questions posed by Gao and Kitaev[5]. This was done by thoroughly analysing the avoidance sets and developing recursive algorithms to derive these sets and their corresponding combinatorial objects in parallel, which yielded a natural bijection. We also analysed an avoidance set whose simple permutations are enumerated by the Fibonacci numbers and derived an algorithm to obtain them recursively.

Xing	National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures and school of Physics Nanjing University Nanjing 210093 China	20pchenweis@gmail.com pchenweis@gmail.com	The 1D hinge states are the hallmark of the 3D higher-order topological insulators (HOTI), which may lead to interesting transport properties. Here, we study the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect in the interferometer constructed by the hinge states in the normal metal-HOTI junctions with a transverse magnetic field. We show that the AB oscillation of the conductance can clearly manifest the spatial configurations of such hinge states. The magnetic fluxes encircled by various interfering loops are composed of two basic ones, so that the oscillation of the conductance by varying the magnetic field contains different frequency components universally related to each other. Specifically, the four dominant frequenciesandsatisfy the relations, which generally holds for different magnetic field, sample size, bias voltage and weak disorder. Our results provide a unique and robust signature of the hinge states and pave the way for exploring AB effect in the 3D HOTI.

FA864921P0123.	bouvier3@illinois.edu ksxu2@illinois.edu mornik@illinois.edu	This paper introduces the notion of quantitative resilience of a control system. Following prior work, we study systems enduring a loss of control authority over some of their actuators. Such a malfunction results in actuators producing possibly undesirable inputs over which the controller has real-time readings but no control. By definition, a system is resilient if it can still reach a target after a partial loss of control authority. However, after a malfunction, a resilient system might be significantly slower to reach a target compared to its initial capabilities. We quantify this loss of performance through the new concept of quantitative resilience. We define such a metric as the maximal ratio of the minimal times required to reach any target for the initial and malfunctioning systems. Naive computation of quantitative resilience directly from the definition is a complex task as it requires solving four nested, possibly nonlinear, optimization problems. The main technical contribution of this work is to provide an efficient method to compute quantitative resilience. Relying on control theory and on two novel geometric results we reduce the computation of quantitative resilience to a single linear optimization problem. We illustrate our method on two numerical examples: an opinion dynamics scenario and a trajectory controller for low-thrust spacecrafts.

We study the hearts of these two t-structures and prove that they coincide in case of a weakly bounded below filtration. Prompted by[SŠ20], in which it is proved that the heart of a compactly generated t-structure in a triangulated category with coproduct is a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category, we study the local coherence of the hearts associated with a weakly bounded below Thomason filtration, achieving a useful recursive characterisation in case of a finite length filtration. Low length cases involve hereditary torsion classes of finite type of the ring, and even their Happel–Reiten–Smalø hearts; in these cases, the relevant characterisations are given by few module-theoretic conditions.

By employing the inter-sample randomness as indicator, we manage to locate the MBL transition point in both orthogonal and unitary models. We further count the-th order gap ratio distributions at the transition region up to, and find they fit well with the short-range plasma model (SRPM) with inverse temperaturefor orthogonal model andfor unitary. These critical level statistics are argued to be universal by comparing results from systems both with and without totalconservation. We also point out that these critical distributions can emerge from the spectrum of a Poisson ensemble, which indicates the thermal-MBL transition point is more affected by the MBL phase rather than thermal phase.	
[2101.12066] Some aspects of the cosmological dynamics in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity	Dmitry Chirkov Sergey A. Pavluchenko	Sternberg Astronomical Institute Moscow State University Moscow RussiaBauman Moscow State Technical University Moscow Russia		We study some aspects of dynamical compactification scenario where stabilisation of extra dimensions occurs due to presence the Gauss-Bonnet term and non-zero spatial curvature. In the framework of the model under consideration there exists two-stages scenario of evolution of a Universe: on the first stage, the space evolves from a totally anisotropic state to the state with 3-dimensional (corresponding to our “real” world) expanding and-dimensional contracting isotropic subspaces; on the second stage, constant curvature of extra dimensions begins to play role and provide compactification of extra dimensions. It is already known that such a scenario is realizable when constant curvature of extra dimensions is negative. Here we show that a range of coupling constants for which exponential solutions with 3-dimensional expanding and-dimensional contracting isotropic subspaces are stable is located in a zone where compactification solutions with positively curved extra space are unstable, so that two-stage scenario analogous to the one described above isnotrealizable. Also we study “nearly-Friedmann” regime for the case of arbitrary constant curvature of extra dimensions and describe new parametrization of the general solution for the model under consideration which provide elegant way of describing areas of existence over parameters space.	
[2101.12067] The galaxy-galaxy strong lensing cross-sections of simulated ΛCDM galaxy clusters	Andrew RobertsonInstitute for Computational Cosmology, Durham University, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, UK		andrew.robertson@durham.ac.uk	We investigate a recent claim that observed galaxy clusters produce an order of magnitude more galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) than simulated clusters in aCDM cosmology. We take galaxy clusters from thec-eaglehydrodynamical simulations and calculate the expected amount of GGSL for sources placed behind the clusters at different redshifts. The probability of a source lensed by one of the most massivec-eagleclusters being multiply imaged by an individual cluster member is in good agreement with that inferred for observed clusters. We show that numerically converged results for the GGSL probability require higher resolution simulations than had been used previously. On top of this, different galaxy formation models predict cluster substructures with different central densities, such that the GGSL probabilities inCDM cannot yet be robustly predicted. Overall, we find that galaxy-galaxy strong lensing within clusters is not currently in tension with theCDM cosmological model.	galaxies: clusters: general | gravitational lensing: strong
[2101.12068] The Newcomb–Benford law: Scale invariance and a simple Markov process based on it	Andrea Burgos Andrés Santos		andres@unex.es anburgosr@alumnos.unex.es	The Newcomb–Benford law, also known as the first-digit law, gives the probability distribution associated with the first digit of a dataset, so that, for example, the first significant digit has a probability of% of beingand% of being. This law can be extended to the second and next significant digits. This article presents an introduction to the discovery of the law, its derivation from the scale invariance property, as well as some applications and examples. Additionally, a simple model of a Markov process inspired by scale invariance is proposed. Within this model, it is proved that the probability distribution irreversibly converges to the Newcomb–Benford law, in analogy to the irreversible evolution toward equilibrium of physical systems in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

We derive precise limits on its parameter space relevant for the anomalies from the current LHC high-dilepton data. We consider an exhaustive list of possible-anomalies-motivated simple scenarios with one or two new couplings that can also be used as templates for obtaining bounds on more complicated scenarios. To obtain precise limits, we systematically consider all possibleproduction processes that can contribute to the dilepton searches, including the resonant pair and single productions, nonresonant-channelexchange, as well as its large interference with the Standard Model background. We demonstrate how the inclusion of resonant production contributions in the dilepton signal can lead to appreciably improved exclusion limits. We point out new search channels ofthat can act as unique tests of the flavour-motivated models. The template scenarios can also be used for futuresearches at the LHC. We compare the LHC limits with other relevant flavour bounds and find that a TeV-scalecan accommodate bothandanomalies while satisfying all the bounds.

[2101.12071] Determining the Angle-of-Arrival of an Radio-Frequency Source with a Rydberg Atom-Based Sensor	Amy K. Robinson Nikunjkumar Prajapati Damir Senic Matthew T. Simons Christopher L. Holloway	thanks:	christopher.holloway@nist.gov	In this work, we demonstrate the use of a Rydberg atom-based sensor for determining the angle-of-arrival of an incident radio-frequency (RF) wave or signal. The technique uses electromagnetically induced transparency in Rydberg atomic vapor in conjunction with a heterodyne Rydberg atom-based mixer. The Rydberg atom mixer measures the phase of the incident RF wave at two different locations inside an atomic vapor cell. The phase difference at these two locations is related to the direction of arrival of the incident RF wave. To demonstrate this approach, we measure phase differences of an incident 19.18 GHz wave at two locations inside a vapor cell filled with cesium atoms for various incident angles. Comparisons of these measurements to both full-wave simulation and to a plane-wave theoretical model show that these atom-based sub-wavelength phase measurements can be used to determine the angle-of-arrival of an RF field.	
[2101.12072] Autoregressive Denoising Diffusion Models for Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting	Kashif Rasul Calvin Seward Ingmar Schuster Roland Vollgraf			In this work, we proposeTimeGrad, an autoregressive model for multivariate probabilistic time series forecasting which samples from the data distribution at each time step by estimating its gradient. To this end, we use diffusion probabilistic models, a class of latent variable models closely connected to score matching and energy-based methods. Our model learns gradients by optimizing a variational bound on the data likelihood and at inference time converts white noise into a sample of the distribution of interest through a Markov chain using Langevin sampling. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed autoregressive denoising diffusion model is the new state-of-the-art multivariate probabilistic forecasting method on real-world data sets with thousands of correlated dimensions. We hope that this method is a useful tool for practitioners and lays the foundation for future research in this area.	Time Series and Sequences | Generative Models

To overcome this issue, several neural few-shot classification models have emerged, yielding significant progress over time, both in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. In the latter, such models used to rely on fixed word embeddings before the advent of transformers. Additionally, some models used in Computer Vision are yet to be tested in NLP applications. In this paper, we compare all these models, first adapting those made in the field of image processing to NLP, and second providing them access to transformers. We then test these models equipped with the same transformer-based encoder on the intent detection task, known for having a large number of classes. Our results reveal that while methods perform almost equally on the ARSC dataset, this is not the case for the Intent Detection task, where the most recent and supposedly best competitors perform worse than older and simpler ones (while all are given access to transformers). We also show that a simple baseline is surprisingly strong. All the new developed models, as well as the evaluation framework, are made publicly available111https://github.com/tdopierre/FewShotText.	
[2101.12074] Experimental test of sequential weak measurements for certified quantum randomness extraction	Giulio Foletto Matteo Padovan Marco Avesani Hamid Tebyanian Paolo Villoresi Giuseppe Vallone	thanks:	vallone@dei.unipd.it	Quantum nonlocality offers a secure way to produce random numbers: Their unpredictability is intrinsic and can be certified just by observing the statistic of the measurement outcomes, without assumptions on how they are produced. To do this, entangled pairs are generated and measured to violate a Bell inequality with the outcome statistics. However, after a projective quantum measurement, entanglement is entirely destroyed and cannot be used again. This fact poses an upper bound to the amount of randomness that can be produced from each quantum state when projective measurements are employed. Instead, by using weak measurements, some entanglement can be maintained and reutilized, and a sequence of weak measurements can extract an unbounded amount of randomness from a single state as predicted in Phys. Rev. A95, 020102(R) (2017). We study the feasibility of these weak measurements, analyze the robustness to imperfections in the quantum state they are applied to, and then test them using an optical setup based on polarization-entangled photon pairs. We show that the weak measurements are realizable, but can improve the performance of randomness generation only in close-to-ideal conditions.

Löffler 	joerg.loeffler@mat.ethz.ch leonardo.pierobon@mat.ethz.ch	The characteristic microstructure of Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)alloys with SmCocell walls in SmCocells, all intersected by Zr-rich platelets, makes them some of the best performing high-temperature permanent magnets. Plentiful research has been performed to tailor the microstructure at the nanoscale, but due to its complexity many questions remain unanswered about the effect of the individual phases on the magnetic performance at different temperatures. Here, we explore this mechanism effect for three different Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)alloys by deploying high-resolution magnetic imaging via in-situ transmission electron microscopy and three-dimensional chemical analysis using atom probe tomography. We show that their microstructures differ in terms of SmCocell-wall and Z-phase size and density, as well as the Cu concentration in the cell walls, and demonstrate how these features influence the magnetic domain size and density and thus form different magnetic textures. Moreover, we illustrate that the dominant coercivity mechanism at room temperature is domain-wall pinning and show that magnets with a denser cell-wall network, a steeper Cu gradient across the cell-wall boundary, and thinner Z-phase platelets have a higher coercivity. We also show that the coercivity mechanism at high temperatures is domain-wall nucleation at the cell walls. Increasing the Cu concentration inside the cell walls decreases the transition temperature between pinning and nucleation, significantly decreasing the coercivity with increasing temperature. We therefore provide a detailed explanation of how the microstructure on the atomic to nanoscale directly affects the magnetic performance and provide detailed guidelines for an improved design of Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)magnets.

[2101.12079] Sheffer operation in relational systems	Ivan Chajda and Helmut Länger	footnotetext:	ivan.chajda@upol.cz helmut.laenger@tuwien.ac.at	The concept of a Sheffer operation known for Boolean algebras and orthomodular lattices is extended to arbitrary directed relational systems with involution. It is proved that to every such relational system there can be assigned a Sheffer groupoid and also, conversely, every Sheffer groupoid induces a directed relational system with involution. Hence, investigations of these relational systems can be transformed to the treaty of special groupoids which form a variety of algebras. If the Sheffer operation is also commutative then the induced binary relation is antisymmetric. Moreover, commutative Sheffer groupoids form a congruence distributive variety. We characterize symmertry, antisymmetry and treansitivity of binary relations by identities and quasi-identities satisfied by an assigned Sheffer operation. The concepts of twist-products of relational systems and of Kleene relational systems are introduced. We prove that every directed relational system can be embedded into a directed relational system with involution via the twist-product construction. If the relation in question is even transitive, then the directed relational system can be embedded into a Kleene relational system. Any Sheffer operation assigned to a directed relational systemwith involution induces a Sheffer operation assigned to the twist-product of.	
[2101.12080] Two-Sided Matching Markets in the ELLIS 2020 PhD Program	Maximilian Mordig Riccardo Della Vecchia Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi Bernhard Schölkopf			The ELLIS PhD program is a European initiative that supports excellent young researchers by connecting them to leading researchers in AI. In particular, PhD students are supervised by two advisors from different countries: an advisor and a co-advisor. In this work we summarize the procedure that, in its final step, matches students to advisors in the ELLIS 2020 PhD program. The steps of the procedure are based on the extensive literature of two-sided matching markets and the college admissions problem(Knuth and De Bruijn,1997; Gale and Shapley,1962; Roth and Sotomayor,1992). We introducePolyGS, an algorithm for the case of two-sided markets with quotas on both sides (also known as many-to-many markets) which we use throughout the selection procedure of pre-screening, interview matching and final matching with advisors. The algorithm returns a stable matching in the sense that no unmatched persons prefer to be matched together rather than with their current partners (given their indicated preferences).Roth (1984)gives evidence that only stable matchings are likely to be adhered to over time. Additionally, the matching is student-optimal. Preferences are constructed based on the rankings each side gives to the other side and the overlaps of research fields. We present and discuss the matchings that the algorithm produces in the ELLIS 2020 PhD program.	
[2101.12081] Generalising via Meta-Examples for Continual Learning in the Wild	Alessia Bertugli Stefano Vincenzi Simone Calderara Andrea Passerini	institutetext:	name.surname@unitn.it name.surname@unimore.it	Future deep learning systems call for techniques that can deal with the evolving nature of temporal data and scarcity of annotations when new problems occur. As a step towards this goal, we present FUSION (Few-shot UnSupervIsed cONtinual learning), a learning strategy that enables a neural network to learn quickly and continually on streams of unlabelled data and unbalanced tasks. The objective is to maximise the knowledge extracted from the unlabelled data stream (unsupervised), favor the forward transfer of previously learnt tasks and features (continual) and exploit as much as possible the supervised information when available (few-shot). The core of FUSION is MEML - Meta-Example Meta-Learning – that consolidates a meta-representation through the use of a self-attention mechanism during a single inner loop in the meta-optimisation stage. To further enhance the capability of MEML to generalise from few data, we extend it by creating various augmented surrogate tasks and by optimising over the hardest. An extensive experimental evaluation on public computer vision benchmarks shows that FUSION outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions both in the few-shot and continual learning experimental settings.111The code is available athttps://github.com/alessiabertugli/FUSION	Continual Learning Meta-Learning Representation Learning.

The challenge lies in that visual encoding in brain is highly complex and not fully revealed. Inspired by the theory that visual features are hierarchically represented in cortex, we propose to break the complex visual signals into multi-level components and decode each component separately. Specifically, we decode shape and semantic representations from the lower and higher visual cortex respectively, and merge the shape and semantic information to images by a generative adversarial network (Shape-Semantic GAN). This ’divide and conquer’ strategy captures visual information more accurately. Experiments demonstrate that Shape-Semantic GAN improves the reconstruction similarity and image quality, and achieves the state-of-the-art image reconstruction performance.

We definerisk-sensitive safe setsas sub-level sets of the solution to a non-standard optimal control problem, where a random maximum cost is assessed via Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). The objective function represents the maximum extent of constraint violation of the state trajectory, averaged over a given percentage of worst cases. This problem is well-motivated but difficult to solve tractably because the temporal decomposition for CVaR is history-dependent. Our primary theoretical contribution is to derive computationally tractable under-approximations to risk-sensitive safe sets. Our method provides a novel, theoretically guaranteed, parameter-dependent upper bound to the CVaR of a maximum cost without the need to augment the state space. For a fixed parameter value, the solution to only one Markov decision process problem is required to obtain the under-approximations for any family of risk-sensitivity levels. In addition, we propose a second definition for risk-sensitive safe sets and provide a tractable method for their estimation without using a parameter-dependent upper bound. The second definition is expressed in terms of a new coherent risk functional, which is inspired by CVaR. We demonstrate our primary theoretical contribution via numerical examples.	{IEEEkeywords}
[2101.12087] Learning Structural Edits via Incremental Tree Transformations	Ziyu Yao Frank F. Xu, Pengcheng YinThe Ohio State University Carnegie Mellon  Sun Graham NeubigThe Ohio State University Carnegie Mellon	Work done while interning at CMU.	yao.470@osu.edu gneubig@cs.cmu.edu sun.397@osu.edu	While most neural generative models generate outputs in a single pass, the human creative process is usually one of iterative building and refinement. Recent work has proposed models of editing processes, but these mostly focus on editing sequential data and/or only model a single editing pass. In this paper, we present a generic model for incremental editing of structured data (i.e.“structural edits”). Particularly, we focus on tree-structured data, taking abstract syntax trees of computer programs as our canonical example. Our editor learns to iteratively generate tree edits (e.g.deleting or adding a subtree) and applies them to the partially edited data, thereby the entire editing process can be formulated as consecutive, incremental tree transformations. To show the unique benefits of modeling tree edits directly, we further propose a novel edit encoder for learning to represent edits, as well as an imitation learning method that allows the editor to be more robust. We evaluate our proposed editor on two source code edit datasets, where results show that, with the proposed edit encoder, our editor significantly improves accuracy over previous approaches that generate the edited program directly in one pass. Finally, we demonstrate that training our editor to imitate experts and correct its mistakes dynamically can further improve its performance.

In this paper, we consider the immersed boundary method (IBM) for biofluid systems, and to alleviate the computational cost, we apply reduced-order techniques to eliminate the degrees of freedom associated with the large number of fluid variables. We show how reduced models can be derived using Petrov-Galerkin projection and subspaces that maintain the incompressibility condition. More importantly, the reduced-order model is shown to preserve the Lyapunov stability. We also address the practical issue of computing coefficient matrices in the reduced-order model using an interpolation technique. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed formulation are examined with test examples from various applications.

[2101.12090] Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning Based Power Allocation in a Massive MIMO Network	B. R. Manoj, Meysam Sadeghi, and Erik G. Larsson	This work was supported in part by Security-Link.Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY) Linköping University Linköping SwedenEmails:		Deep learning (DL) is becoming popular as a new tool for many applications in wireless communication systems. However, for many classification tasks (e.g., modulation classification) it has been shown that DL-based wireless systems are susceptible to adversarial examples; adversarial examples are well-crafted malicious inputs to the neural network (NN) with the objective to cause erroneous outputs. In this paper, we extend this to regression problems and show that adversarial attacks can break DL-based power allocation in the downlink of a massive multiple-input-multiple-output (maMIMO) network. Specifically, we extend the fast gradient sign method (FGSM), momentum iterative FGSM, and projected gradient descent adversarial attacks in the context of power allocation in a maMIMO system. We benchmark the performance of these attacks and show that with a small perturbation in the input of the NN, the white-box attacks can result in infeasible solutions up to 86%. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of black-box attacks. All the evaluations conducted in this work are based on an open dataset and NN models, which are publicly available.

[2101.12091] Performance Comparison between Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface and Relays: Theoretical Methods and a Perspective from Operator	Qi Gu, Dan Wu, Xin Su, Jing Jin, Yifei Yuan, and Jiangzhou WangFuture Mobile Technology Laboratory, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, ChinaSchool of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, Canterbury, U.K.E-mail:{guqi, wudan, suxin, jinjing,		j.z.wang@kent.ac.uk	Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an emerging technique employing metasurface to reflect the signal from the source node to the destination node without consuming any energy. Not only the spectral efficiency but also the energy efficiency can be improved through RIS. Essentially, RIS can be considered as a passive relay between the source and destination node. On the other hand, a relay node in a traditional relay network has to be active, which indicates that it will consume energy when it is relaying the signal or information between the source and destination nodes. In this paper, we compare the performances between RIS and active relay for a general multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. To make the comparison fair and comprehensive, both the performances of RIS and active relay are optimized with best-effort. In terms of the RIS, transmit beamforming and reflecting coefficient at the RIS are jointly optimized so as to maximize the end-to-end throughput. Although the optimization problem is non-convex, it is transformed equivalently to a weighted mean-square error (MSE) minimization problem and an alternating optimization problem is proposed, which can ensure the convergence to a stationary point. In terms of active relay, both half duplex relay (HDR) and full duplex relay (FDR) are considered. End-to-end throughput is maximized via an alternating optimization method. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Finally, comparisons between RIS and relays are investigated from the perspective of system model, performance, deployment and controlling method.

In order to achieve low latency, traditionalAS2models score question-answer pairs individually, ignoring any information from the document each potential answer was extracted from. In contrast, more computationally expensive models designed for machine reading comprehension tasks typically receive one or more passages as input, which often results in better accuracy. In this work, we present an approach to efficiently incorporate contextual information inAS2models. For each answer candidate, we first use unsupervised similarity techniques to extract relevant sentences from its source document, which we then feed into an efficient transformer architecture fine-tuned forAS2. Our best approach, which leverages a multi-way attention architecture to efficiently encode context, improves 6% to 11% over non-contextual state of the art inAS2with minimal impact on system latency. All experiments in this work were conducted in English.

Rovisco Pais 1 1049-001 Lisboa PortugalMax Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) 14476 Potsdam-Golm GermanyTheoretical Physics Institute University of Jena 07743 Jena Germany		We present an implementation of the dual foliation generalized harmonic gauge (DF-GHG) formulation within the pseudospectral codebamps. The formalism promises to give greater freedom in the choice of coordinates that can be used in numerical relativity. As a specific application we focus here on the treatment of black holes in spherical symmetry. Existing approaches to black hole excision in numerical relativity are susceptible to failure if the boundary fails to remain outflow. We present a method, called DF-excision, to avoid this failure. Our approach relies on carefully choosing coordinates in which the coordinate lightspeeds are under strict control. These coordinates are then combined with the DF-GHG formulation. After performing a set of validation tests in a simple setting, we study the accretion of large pulses of scalar field matter on to a spherical black hole. We compare the results of DF-excision with a naive setup. DF-excision proves reliable even when the previous approach fails.

They are also equal to the densities of critical percolation clusters on forty five degree rotated square lattice rolled into a cylinder, which do not or do wrap around the cylinder respectively. The results are presented as explicit rational functions oftaking rational values for any even. Their asymptotic expansions in the largelimit have irrational coefficients reproducing the earlier results in the leading orders.

Zins	institutetext:	jstadler@mpe.mpg.de fwidmann@mpe.mpg.de	The GRAVITY instrument on the ESO VLTI pioneers the field of high-precision near-infrared interferometry by providing astrometry at thelevel. Measurements at such high precision crucially depend on the control of systematic effects. Here, we investigate how aberrations introduced by small optical imperfections along the path from the telescope to the detector affect the astrometry. We develop an analytical model that describes the impact of such aberrations on the measurement of complex visibilities. Our formalism accounts for pupil-plane and focal-plane aberrations, as well as for the interplay between static and turbulent aberrations, and successfully reproduces calibration measurements of a binary star. The Galactic Center observations with GRAVITY in 2017 and 2018, when both Sgr A* and the star S2 were targeted in a single fiber pointing, are affected by these aberrations at a level of less than 0.5 mas. Removal of these effects brings the measurement in harmony with the dual beam observations of 2019 and 2020, which are not affected by these aberrations. This also resolves the small systematic discrepancies between the derived distanceto the Galactic Center reported previously.

[2101.12099] An Analysis Of Protected Health Information Leakage In Deep-Learning Based De-Identification Algorithms	Salman Seyedi,1Li Xiong,2Shamim Nemati,3Gari D. Clifford1,4			The increasing complexity of algorithms for analyzing medical data, including de-identification tasks, raises the possibility that complex algorithms are learning not just the general representation of the problem, but specifics of given individuals within the data. Modern legal frameworks specifically prohibit the intentional or accidental distribution of patient data, but have not addressed this potential avenue for leakage of such protected health information. Modern deep learning algorithms have the highest potential of such leakage due to complexity of the models. Recent research in the field has highlighted such issues in non-medical data, but all analysis is likely to be data and algorithm specific. We, therefore, chose to analyze a state-of-the-art free-text de-identification algorithm based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and its potential in encoding any individual in the training set. Using the i2b2 Challenge Data, we trained, then analyzed the model to assess whether the output of the LSTM, before the compression layer of the classifier, could be used to estimate the membership of the training data. Furthermore, we used different attacks including membership inference attack method to attack the model. Results indicate that the attacks could not identify whether members of the training data were distinguishable from non-members based on the model output. This indicates that the model does not provide any strong evidence into the identification of the individuals in the training data set and there is not yet empirical evidence it is unsafe to distribute the model for general use.

Although several methods have been proposed to improve the trustworthiness of deep neural networks, most of them are tailored for specific classes of adversarial examples, hence failing to detect other corner cases or unsafe inputs that heavily deviate from the training samples.

Jelena DiakonikolasDepartment of Computer SciencesUniversity of  Puqian WangSchool of MathematicsShandong	thanks:	e.puqian.wang@gmail.com jelena@cs.wisc.edu	Making the gradients small is a fundamental optimization problem that has eluded unifying and simple convergence arguments in first-order optimization, so far primarily reserved for other convergence criteria, such as reducing the optimality gap. We introduce a novel potential function-based framework to study the convergence of standard methods for making the gradients small in smooth convex optimization and convex-concave min-max optimization. Our framework is intuitive and it provides a lens for viewing algorithms that make the gradients small as being driven by a trade-off between reducing either the gradient norm or a certain notion of an optimality gap. On the lower bounds side, we discuss tightness of the obtained convergence results for the convex setup and provide a new lower bound for minimizing norm of cocoercive operators that allows us to argue about optimality of methods in the min-max setup.

The equation is studied in presence of an external potential field whose time-dependent amplitude is taken as control. Assuming that the potential satisfies a saturation property, we show that the NLS equation is approximately controllable between any pair of eigenstates in arbitrarily small time. The proof is obtained by developing a multiplicative version of a geometric control approach introduced by Agrachev and Sarychev. We give an application of this result to the study of the large time behavior of the NLS equation with random potential. More precisely, we assume that the amplitude of the potential is a random process whose law is-periodic in time and non-degenerate. Combining the controllability with a stopping time argument and the Markov property, we show that the trajectories of the random equation are almost surely unbounded in regular Sobolev spaces.

We show that the equilibrium curves of the system exhibit a limit load when the induced stiffness parameter gets bigger than a threshold. This limit load increases when increasing the stiffness parameter and is related to a possible localized path in the post-buckling domain. Such a change in the maximum load may be very desirable from a structural stand point.	Buckling | Fiber composite | Initial curvature | Compression-induced stiffness | Limit point

Tyson222Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of British Columbia Okanagan, Kelowna, BC, Canada, and Sebastian Wieczorek			We identify thephase of a cycleas a new critical factor for tipping points (critical transitions) in cyclic systems subject to time-varying external conditions. As an example, we consider how contemporary climate variability induces tipping from a predator-prey cycle to extinction in two paradigmatic predator-prey models with an Allee effect. Our analysis of these examples uncovers a counter-intuitive behaviour, which we call phase tipping orP-tipping, where tipping to extinction occurs only from certain phases of the cycle. To explain this behaviour, we combine global dynamics with set theory and introduce the concept ofpartial basin instabilityfor attracting limit cycles. This concept provides a general framework to analyse and identify easily testable criteria for the occurrence of phase tipping in externally forced systems, and can be extended to more complicated attractors.

Their physical properties are analyzed in detail. The energy density appears to be necessarily negative, which suggests that any possible application of this kind of fluids requires extreme physical conditions where quantum effects are expected to play an important role. Also, it is found that the fluid distribution cannot fill the region close to the center of symmetry. Such a region may be represented by a vacuum cavity around the center. A suitable definition of mass function, as well as the Tolman mass are explicitly calculated. While the former is positive defined, the latter is negative in most cases, revealing the repulsive nature of gravitational interaction. A general approach to obtain exact solutions is presented and some exact analytical solutions are exhibited.	Relativistic Fluids | nonspherical sources | interior solutions.

BahéLeiden Observatory, Leiden University, PO Box 9513, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands	E-mail:	bahe@strw.leidenuniv.nl	Strong gravitational lensing observations can test structure formation models by constraining the masses and concentrations of subhaloes in massive galaxy clusters. Recent work has concluded that cluster subhaloes are more abundant and/or concentrated than predicted byCDM simulations; this finding has been interpreted as arising from unidentified issues with simulations or an incorrect understanding of the nature of dark matter. We test these hypotheses by comparing observed subhalo masses and maximum circular velocitiesto predictions from the high resolution Hydrangea galaxy cluster simulation suite, which is based on the successful EAGLE galaxy formation model. The simulated subhalo mass distribution and mass–relation agrees well with observations, due to the presence of baryons during tidal stripping. Similar agreement is found for the lower-resolution Illustris-TNG300 simulation. In combination, our results suggest that the abundance and concentration of cluster substructures are not in tension withCDM, but may provide useful constraints for the refinement of baryon physics models in simulations.	galaxies: clusters: general – methods: numerical – dark matter
[2101.12113] Low Complexity Approximate Bayesian Logistic Regression for Sparse Online Learning	Gil I. ShamirGoogle6425 Penn Ave. Suite  SzpankowskiPurdue UniversityW. Lafayette, IN	The work of the second author was done while he was visiting Google.	szpan@purdue.edu gshamir@ieee.org	Theoretical results show that Bayesian methods can achieve lower bounds on regret for online logistic regression. In practice, however, such techniques may not be feasible especially for very large feature sets. Various approximations that, for huge sparse feature sets, diminish the theoretical advantages, must be used. Often, they apply stochastic gradient methods with hyper-parameters that must be tuned on some surrogate loss, defeating theoretical advantages of Bayesian methods. The surrogate loss, defined to approximate the mixture, requires techniques as Monte Carlo sampling, increasing computations per example. We propose low complexity analytical approximations for sparse online logistic and probit regressions. Unlike variational inference and other methods, our methods use analytical closed forms, substantially lowering computations. Unlike dense solutions, as Gaussian Mixtures, our methods allow for sparse problems with huge feature sets without increasing complexity. With the analytical closed forms, there is also no need for applying stochastic gradient methods on surrogate losses, and for tuning and balancing learning and regularization hyper-parameters. Empirical results top the performance of the more computationally involved methods. Like such methods, our methods still reveal per feature and per example uncertainty measures.

Using density functional theory (DFT), we identify several previously unknown polar and non-polar structures within the low-energy phase space of perovskite-structure bismuth ferrite, BiFeO. Of particular interest is a series of non-centrosymmetric structures with polarisation along one lattice vector, combined with anti-polar distortions, reminiscent of ferroelectric domains, along a perpendicular direction. We discuss possible routes to stabilising the new phases using biaxial heteroepitaxial strain or interfacial electrostatic control in heterostructures.

The algorithm relies on Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the system dynamics and on a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the policy gradient. This defines a framework in which we ablate the choice of the following components: (i) the selection of the cost function, (ii) the optimization of policies using dropout, (iii) an improved data efficiency through the use of structured kernels in the GP models. The combination of the aforementioned aspects affects dramatically the performance of MC-PILCO. Numerical comparisons in a simulated cart-pole environment show that MC-PILCO exhibits better data efficiency and control performance w.r.t. state-of-the-art GP-based MBRL algorithms. Finally, we apply MC-PILCO to real systems, considering in particular systems with partially measurable states. We discuss the importance of modeling both the measurement system and the state estimators during policy optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed solutions has been tested in simulation and on two real systems, a Furuta pendulum and a ball-and-plate rig.

In this work, we implement the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which is a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), to predict ground-state binding energies of atomic nuclei. Two different MLP architectures with three and four hidden layers are used to study their effects on the predictions. To train the MLP architectures, two different inputs are used along with the latest atomic mass table and changes in binding energy predictions are also analyzed in terms of the changes in the input channel. It is seen that using appropriate MLP architectures and putting more physical information in the input channels, MLP can make fast and reliable predictions for binding energies of atomic nuclei, which is also comparable to the microscopic energy density functionals.

Ultracold bosons are considered at the small finite temperatures. Bosons are considered as two different fluids: Bose-Einstein condensate and normal fluid (the thermal component). An extended hydrodynamic model is obtained for both fluids, where the pressure evolution equations and the pressure flux third rank tensor evolution equations are considered along with the continuity and Euler equations. It is found that the pressure evolution equation contains zero contribution of the short-range interaction. The pressure flux evolution equation contains the interaction which gives the quantum fluctuations in the zero temperature limit. Here, we obtain its generalization for the finite temperature. The contribution of interaction in the pressure flux evolution equation which goes to zero in the zero temperature limit is found. The model is obtained via the straightforward derivation from the microscopic many-particle Schrodinger equation in the coordinate representation.

[2101.12120] An Optimal Control Strategy for Mathematically Modeling Cancer Combination Therapy	Jayanth S. PratapDulles Math and Science AcademyPresented at the 3rdSystems Approaches to Cancer Biology ConferenceNovember 11th- 13th, 2020	footnotemark:		While the use of combination therapy is increasing in prevalence for cancer treatment, it is often difficult to predict the exact interactions between different treatment forms, and their synergistic/antagonistic effects on patient health and therapy outcome. In this research, a system of ordinary differential equations is constructed to model nonlinear dynamics between tumor cells, immune cells, and three forms of therapy: chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy. This model is then used to generate optimized combination therapy plans using optimal control theory. In-silico experiments are conducted to simulate the response of the patient model to various treatment plans. This is the first mathematical model in current literature to introduce radiotherapy as an option alongside immuno- and chemotherapy, permitting more flexible and effective treatment plans that reflect modern therapeutic approaches.	
[2101.12121] On Mutual Information Analysis of Infectious Disease Transmission via Particle Propagation	Peter Adam Hoeher, Martin Damrath, Sunasheer Bhattacharjee, and Max Schurwanz	P. A. Hoeher M. Damrath S. Bhattacharjee and M. Schurwanz are with the Faculty of Engineering Kiel University Kiel Germany e-mail:		Besides mimicking bio-chemical and multi-scale communication mechanisms, molecular communication forms a theoretical framework for virus infection processes. Towards this goal, aerosol and droplet transmission has recently been modeled as a multiuser scenario. In this letter, the “infection performance” is evaluated by means of a mutual information analysis, and by an even simpler probabilistic performance measure which is closely related to absorbed viruses. The so-called infection rate depends on the distribution of the channel input events as well as on the transition probabilities between channel input and output events. The infection rate is investigated analytically for five basic discrete memoryless channel models. Numerical results for the transition probabilities are obtained by Monte Carlo simulations for pathogen-laden particle transmission in four typical indoor environments: two-person office, corridor, classroom, and bus. Particle transfer contributed significantly to infectious diseases like SARS-CoV-2 and influenza.	Aerosols | computer simulation | molecular communication | multiuser channels | mutual information.

A recently proposed way to hide an individual’s genetic information is to mix in DNA samples of other individuals. We assume these samples are known to the individual but unknown to the sequencing laboratory. Thus, these DNA samples act as “noise” to the sequencing laboratory, but still allow the individual to recover their own DNA samples afterward. Motivated by this idea, we study the problem of hiding a binary random variable(a genetic marker) with the additive noise provided by mixing DNA samples, using mutual information as a privacy metric. This is equivalent to the problem of finding a worst-case noise distribution for recoveringfrom the noisy observation among a set of feasible discrete distributions. We characterize upper and lower bounds to the solution of this problem, which are empirically shown to be very close. The lower bound is obtained through a convex relaxation of the original discrete optimization problem, and yields a closed-form expression. The upper bound is computed via a greedy algorithm for selecting the mixing proportions.	DNA sequencing | genetic privacy | additive discrete noise | worst-case noise distribution.

It is found that the HOM effect depends directly on the relativistic time dilation between the arms of the setup. This temporal dilation can be used to estimate theandparameters of the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism. The uncertainty in the parametersandare of the order, depending on the quantum state employed.	
[2101.12127] tf.data: A Machine Learning Data Processing Framework	Derek G. Murray Jiří Šimša Ana Klimovic Ihor Indyk	Microsoft		Training machine learning models requires feeding input data for models to ingest. Input pipelines for machine learning jobs are often challenging to implement efficiently as they require reading large volumes of data, applying complex transformations, and transferring data to hardware accelerators while overlapping computation and communication to achieve optimal performance. We presenttf.data, a framework for building and executing efficient input pipelines for machine learning jobs. Thetf.dataAPI provides operators which can be parameterized with user-defined computation, composed, and reused across different machine learning domains. These abstractions allow users to focus on the application logic of data processing, whiletf.data’s runtime ensures that pipelines run efficiently.

[2101.12129] Mapping the Supernovae Driven Winds of the Large Magellanic Cloud in H𝛼 Emission I	Drew A. Ciampa Kathleen A. Barger Nicolas Lehner Madeline Horn Michael Hernandez L. Matthew Haffner Brianna Smart Chad Bustard Sam Barber Henry Boot	Department of Physics & Astronomy Texas Christian University Fort Worth TX 76129 USA		We present the first spectroscopically resolved Hemission map of the Large Magellanic Cloud’s (LMC) galactic wind. By combining new Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM) observations () with existing Hi21-cm emission observations, we have (1) mapped the LMC’s near-side galactic wind over a local standard of rest (LSR) velocity range of, (2) determined its morphology and extent, and (3) estimated its mass, outflow rate, and mass-loading factor. We observe Hemission from this wind to typically 1-degree off the LMC’s Hidisk. Kinematically, we find that the diffuse gas in the warm-ionized phase of this wind persists at both low () and high () velocities, relative to the LMC’s Hidisk. Furthermore, we find that the high-velocity component spatially aligns with the most intense star-forming region, 30 Doradus. We, therefore, conclude that this high-velocity material traces an active outflow. We estimate the mass of the warm () ionized phase of the near-side LMC outflow to befor the combined low and high velocity components. Assuming an ionization fraction of 75% and that the wind is symmetrical about the LMC disk, we estimate that its total (neutral and ionized) mass is, its mass-flow rate is, and its mass-loading factor is. Our average mass-loading factor results are roughly a factor of 2.5 larger than previous Himaging and UV absorption line studies, suggesting that those studies are missing nearly half the gas in the outflows.

We report results of a search for an isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) using data from Advanced LIGO’s and Advanced Virgo’s third observing run (O3) combined with upper limits from the earlier O1 and O2 runs. Unlike in previous observing runs in the advanced detector era, we include Virgo in the search for the GWB. The results of the search are consistent with uncorrelated noise, and therefore we place upper limits on the strength of the GWB. We find that the dimensionless energy densityat thecredible level for a flat (frequency-independent) GWB, using a prior which is uniform in the log of the strength of the GWB, with 99% of the sensitivity coming from the band 20-76.6Hz;at 25 Hz for a power-law GWB with a spectral index of 2/3 (consistent with expectations for compact binary coalescences), in the band 20-90.6Hz; andat 25 Hz for a spectral index of 3, in the band 20-291.6Hz. These upper limits improve over our previous results by a factor of6.0for a flat GWB,8.8for a spectral index of 2/3, and13.1for a spectral index of 3. We also search for a GWB arising from scalar and vector modes, which are predicted by alternative theories of gravity; we do not find evidence of these, and place upper limits on the strength of GWBs with these polarizations. We demonstrate that there is no evidence of correlated noise of magnetic origin by performing a Bayesian analysis that allows for the presence of both a GWB and an effective magnetic background arising from geophysical Schumann resonances. We compare our upper limits to a fiducial model for the GWB from the merger of compact binaries, updating the model to use the most recent data-driven population inference from the systems detected during O3a. Finally, we combine our results with observations of individual mergers and show that, at design sensitivity, this joint approach may yield stronger constraints on the merger rate of binary black holes atthan can be achieved with individually resolved mergers alone.	
[2101.12131] Probing bino NLSP at lepton colliders	Junmou Chen Chengcheng Han Jin Min Yang Mengchao Zhang	institutetext:	chenjm@jnu.edu.cn jmyang@itp.ac.cn hanhch@mail.sysu.edu.cn mczhang@jnu.edu.cn	We consider a scenario where light bino is the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) and gravitino/axino is the lightest superysmmetric particle (LSP). For a bino mass less than or around hundred GeV, it can be pair produced at the future lepton colliders throughchannel slepton exchange, subsequently decaying into a gravitino/axino plus a photon. We study the prospects to look for such binos at the future colliders and find that a bino mass around 100 GeV can be probed at the() level for a slepton below 2 TeV (1.5 TeV) with a luminosity 3. For a bino mass around 10 GeV, a slepton mass less than 4 TeV (3 TeV) can be probed at the() level, which is much beyond the reach of the LHC for direct slepton searches.	
[2101.12132] Solution methods for the growth of a repeating imperfection in the line of a strut on a nonlinear foundation	R. Lagrange D. Averbuch R. Lagrange D. Averbuch		daniel.averbuch@ifpen.fr romain.g.lagrange@gmail.com	This paper is a theoretical and numerical study of the uniform growth of a repeating sinusoidal imperfection in the line of a strut on a nonlinear elastic Winkler type foundation. The imperfection is introduced by considering an initially deformed shape which is a sine function with an half wavelength. The restoring force is either a bi-linear or an exponential profile. Periodic solutions of the equilibrium problem are found using three different approaches: a semi-analytical method, an explicit solution of a Galerkin method and a direct numerical resolution. These methods are found in very good agreement and show the existence of a maximum imperfection size which leads to a limit point in the equilibrium curve of the system. The existence of this limit point is very important since it governs the appearance of localization phenomena.	Buckling | Nonlinear elastic foundation | Imperfection | Stability and bifurcation

Chávez-Nuñez	institutetext:		An extension of theSemimicroscopic Algebraic Cluster Model(SACM) is proposed, based on thepseudo-model (). The Hamiltonian and the spectroscopic factor operator of the model are presented and a procedure of constructing the model space. Because a huge number ofirreducible representations (irrep) appear, one has to be careful in designing a practical, consistent path to reduce the Hilbert space. The concept offorbiddenness, taking into account excitations of the clusters, is introduced and applied. The applications are to two systems with a low forbiddenness, namely toUPb +Ne andRaPb +C, and toUXe +Sr, which appears in the fission of, which requires a large forbiddenness. Energies, electromagnetic transitions and spectroscopic factors are calculated.	pacs:21.00nuclear structure and 21.60.Csshell model and 21.60.Gxcluster model

Salgado Víctor Vila	institutetext:	victor.vila@polytechnique.edu carlos.salgado@usc.es joaolourenco.henriques@usc.es fabio.dominguez@usc.es	QCD jets produced in heavy-ion collisions at LHC or RHIC energies partially evolve inside the produced hot and dense quark gluon plasma, offering unique opportunities to study QCD splitting processes in different backgrounds. Induced (modified) splittings are expected to be the most relevant mechanism driving the modifications of in-medium jets compared to vacuum jets for a wide sets of observables. Although color coherence among different emitters has been identified as an essential mechanism in studies of theQCD antenna radiation, it is usually neglected in the multi-gluon medium-induced cascade. This independent gluon emission approximation can be analytically proved to be valid in the limit of very large media, but corrections or modifications to it have not been computed before in the context of the evolution (or rate) equation describing the gluon cascade. We propose a modified evolution equation that includes corrections due to the interference of subsequent emitters. In order to do so, we first compute a modified splitting kernel following the usual procedure of factorizing it from the subsequent Brownian motion. The calculation is performed in the two-gluon configuration with no overlapping formation times, that is expected to provide the first correction to the completely independent picture.

[2101.12140] Exactly solvable spin-1/2 XYZ models with highly-degenerate, partially ordered, ground states	Grgur Palle Owen Benton	Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems Nöthnitzer Str. 38 Dresden 01187 GermanyInstitute for Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Wolfgang-Gaede-Straße 1 Karlsruhe 76131 Germany		Exactly solvable models play a special role in Condensed Matter physics, serving as secure theoretical starting points for investigation of new phenomena. Changlaniet al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.120, 117202 (2018)] have discovered a limit of the XXZ model forspins on the kagome lattice, which is not only exactly solvable, but features a huge degeneracy of exact ground states corresponding to solutions of a three-coloring problem. This special point of the model was proposed as a parent for multiple phases in the wider phase diagram, including quantum spin liquids. Here, we show that the construction of Changlaniet al. can be extended to more general forms of anisotropic exchange interaction, finding a line of parameter space in an XYZ model which maintains both the macroscopic degeneracy and the three-coloring structure of solutions. We show that the ground states along this line are partially ordered, in the sense that infinite-range correlations of some spin components coexist with a macroscopic number of undetermined degrees of freedom. We therefore propose the exactly solvable limit of the XYZ model on corner-sharing triangle-based lattices as a tractable starting point for discovery of quantum spin systems which mix ordered and spin liquid-like properties.

Pershin	of Physics Opole University Opole 45-052 Poland	vslipko@uni.opole.pl pershin@physics.sc.edu	We introduce an approach based on the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation to model heterogeneous stochastic circuits, namely, the circuits combining binary or multi-state stochastic memristive devices and continuum reactive components (capacitors and/or inductors). Such circuits are described in terms of occupation probabilities of memristive states that are functions of reactive variables. As an illustrative example, the series circuit of a binary memristor and capacitor is considered in detail. Some analytical solutions are found. Our work offers a novel analytical/numerical tool for modeling complex stochastic networks, which may find a broad range of applications.

One may also extend this to complex-valued functions, onceis paired with a-edge-colouringto assign conjugates. We say thatisreal-norming(resp.complex-norming) if(resp.for some) is a norm on the vector space of real-valued (resp. complex-valued) functions. These generalise the Gowers octahedral norms, a widely used tool in extremal combinatorics to quantify quasirandomness.	
[2101.12146] Low-complexity Rank-Efficient Tensor Completion For Prediction And Online Wireless Edge CachingAuthors are with Institute of digital communications, School of engineering, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK, EH9 3FG. Emails: {ngarg, t.ratnarajah}@ed.ac.uk.	Navneet Garg, , and Tharmalingam Ratnarajah	thanks:		Wireless edge caching is a popular strategy to avoid backhaul congestion in the next generation networks, where the content is cached in advance at base stations to serve redundant requests during peak congestion periods. In the edge caching data, the missing observations are inevitable due to dynamic selective popularity. Among the completion methods, the tensor-based models have been shown to be the most advantageous for missing data imputation. Also, since the observations are correlated across time, files, and base stations, in this paper, we formulate the cooperative caching with recommendations as a fourth-order tensor completion and prediction problem. Since the content library can be large leading to a large dimension tensor, we modify the latent norm-based Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm with towards a much lower time complexity using multi-rank updates, rather than rank-1 updates in literature. This significantly lower time computational overhead leads in developing an online caching algorithm. With MovieLens dataset, simulations show lower reconstruction errors for the proposed algorithm as compared to that of the recent FW algorithm, albeit with lower computation overhead. It is also demonstrated that the completed tensor improves normalized cache hit rates for linear prediction schemes.

McGorty	of Physics and Biophysics University of San Diego San Diego CA 92110 USA	rmcgorty@sandiego.edu	Differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) is increasingly used in the fields of soft matter physics and biophysics to extract the dynamics of microscopic objects across a range of wavevectors using optical microscopy. Standard DDM is limited to detecting dynamics no faster than the camera frame rate. We report on an extension to DDM where we sequentially illuminate the sample with spectrally-distinct light and image with a color camera. By pulsing blue and then red light separated by a lag time much smaller than the camera’s exposure time we are able to use this two-color DDM method to measure dynamics occurring much faster than the camera frame rate.

[2101.12148] The Critical Locus and Rigidity of Foliations of Complex Hénon Maps	Misha Lyubich and John W. Robertson			We study Hénon maps which are perturbations of a hyperbolic polynomialwith connected Julia set. We give a complete description of the critical locus of these maps. In particular, we show that for each critical pointof, there is a primary component of the critical locus asymptotic to the line. Moreover, primary components are conformally equivalent to the punctured disk, and their orbits cover the whole critical set. We also describe the holonomy maps from such a component to itself along the leaves of two natural foliations. Finally, we show that a quadratic Hénon map taken along with the natural pair of foliations, is a rigid object, in the sense that a conjugacy between two such maps respecting the foliations is a holomorphic or antiholomorphic affine map.

Within the new type of mathematization at work in data science, mathematical methods are not selected because of any relevance for a problem at hand; mathematical methods are applied to a specific problem only by ‘forcing’, i.e. on the basis of their ability to reorganize the data for further analysis and the intrinsic richness of their mathematical structure. In particular, we argue that deep learning neural networks are best understood within the context of forcing optimization methods. We finally explore the broader question of the appropriateness of data science methods in solving problems. We argue that this question should not be interpreted as a search for a correspondence between phenomena and specific solutions found by data science methods; rather, it is the internal structure of data science methods that is open to precise forms of understanding.Keywords:Data Science; Methodology of Deep Learning; Ensemble Methods.

Unlike conventional recommendation systems, these new systems solve traditional problems such as the cold start and data sparsity problems. This survey aims to study and systematically classify personality-aware recommendation systems. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first that focuses on personality-aware recommendation systems. We explore the different design choices of personality-aware recommendation systems, by comparing their personality modeling methods, as well as their recommendation techniques. Furthermore, we present the commonly used datasets and point out some of the challenges of personality-aware recommendation systems.

Navneet Garg, Mathini Sellathurai, Tharmalingam RatnarajahThe University of Edinburgh, UK,Heriot-Watt university, Edinburgh, UK	thanks:		Power consumption is one of the major issues in massive MIMO (multiple input multiple output) systems, causing increased long-term operational cost and overheating issues. In this paper, we consider per-antenna power allocation with a given finite set of power levels towards maximizing the long-term energy efficiency of the multi-user systems, while satisfying the QoS (quality of service) constraints at the end users in terms of required SINRs (signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio), which depends on channel information. Assuming channel states to vary as a Markov process, the constraint problem is modeled as an unconstraint problem, followed by the power allocation based on-learning algorithm. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the successful minimization of power consumption while achieving the SINR threshold at users.

In particular we look at T-duality as the symplectic transformation related to an alternative choice of polarisation in the construction of the quantum bundle for the string. Following this perspective we adopt a variety of techniques from geometric quantisation to study the doubled space. One application is the construction of the ""double coherent state"" that provides the shortest distance in any duality frame and a ""stringy deformed"" Fourier transform."

[2101.12156] Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms for agent-based models of disease transmission	Nianqiao Ju Jeremy Heng Pierre E. Jacob	Corresponding author: of Statistics Harvard University USA	nju@g.harvard.edu	Agent-based models of disease transmission involve stochastic rules that specify how a number of individuals would infect one another, recover or be removed from the population. Common yet stringent assumptions stipulate interchangeability of agents and that all pairwise contact are equally likely. Under these assumptions, the population can be summarized by counting the number of susceptible and infected individuals, which greatly facilitates statistical inference. We consider the task of inference without such simplifying assumptions, in which case, the population cannot be summarized by low-dimensional counts. We design improved particle filters, where each particle corresponds to a specific configuration of the population of agents, that take either the next or all future observations into account when proposing population configurations. Using simulated data sets, we illustrate that orders of magnitude improvements are possible over bootstrap particle filters. We also provide theoretical support for the approximations employed to make the algorithms practical.

[2101.12159] Discriminative Appearance Modeling with Multi-track Pooling for Real-time Multi-object Tracking	Chanho KimLi FuxinMazen AlotaibiJames M. RehgGeorgia Institute of TechnologyOregon State University			In multi-object tracking, the tracker maintains in its memory the appearance and motion information for each object in the scene. This memory is utilized for finding matches between tracks and detections and is updated based on the matching result. Many approaches model each target in isolation and lack the ability to use all the targets in the scene to jointly update the memory. This can be problematic when there are similar looking objects in the scene. In this paper, we solve the problem of simultaneously considering all tracks during memory updating, with only a small spatial overhead, via a novel multi-track pooling module. We additionally propose a training strategy adapted to multi-track pooling which generates hard tracking episodes online. We show that the combination of these innovations results in a strong discriminative appearance model, enabling the use of greedy data association to achieve online tracking performance. Our experiments demonstrate real-time, state-of-the-art performance on public multi-object tracking (MOT) datasets. The code and trained models will be released athttps://github.com/chkim403/blstm-mtp.

We analyze a continuous-time model for capacity scaling, where the goal is to minimize the weighted sum of flow-time, switching cost, and power consumption in an online fashion. We propose a novel algorithm, called Adaptive Balanced Capacity Scaling (ABCS), that has access to black-box machine learning predictions. ABCS aims to adapt to the predictions and is also robust against unpredictable surges in the workload. In particular, we prove that ABCS is-competitive if the predictions are accurate, and yet, it has a uniformly bounded competitive ratio even if the predictions are completely inaccurate. Finally, we investigate the performance of this algorithm on a real-world dataset and carry out extensive numerical experiments, which positively support the theoretical results.	Keywords —
[2101.12161] Improved Rate-Energy Trade-off For SWIPT Using Chordal Distance Decomposition In Interference Alignment Networks	Navneet Garg, Avinash Rudraksh, Govind Sharma, Tharmalingam Ratnarajah	N. Garg and T. Ratnarajah are with The University of Edinburgh UK. A. Rudraksha and G. Sharma are with Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur India.

However, harvesting RF energy simultaneously reduces the achievable DoFs. To study a trade-off between harvested energy and sum rate, the transceiver design problem is suboptimally formulated in literature via convex relaxations, which is still computationally intensive, especially for battery limited nodes running on harvested energy. In this paper, we propose a systematic method using chordal distance (CD) decomposition to obtain the balanced precoding, which improves the trade-off. Analysis shows that given the nonnegative value of CD, the achieved harvested energy for the proposed precoder is higher than that for perfect IA precoder. Moreover, energy constraints can be achieved, while maintaining a constant rate loss without losing DoFs via tuning the CD value and splitting factor. Simulation results verify the analysis and add that the IA schemes based on max-SINR or mean-squared error are better suited for SWIPT maximization than subspace or leakage minimization methods.

Its specialisations generalise the Teichmüller polynomial of a fibred face of the Thurston norm ball. We prove that the taut polynomial of a veering triangulation is equal to a certain twisted Alexander polynomial of the underlying manifold. Then we give formulas relating the taut polynomial and the untwisted Alexander polynomial. There are two formulas; one holds when the maximal free abelian cover of a veering triangulation is edge-orientable, another holds when it is not edge-orientable.

Gobetti 101, 40129 Bologna, Italy	E-mail:	nmgaxamba@gmail.com	ACO2163 is one of the hottest (meankeV) and extremely X-ray overluminous merging galaxy clusters which is located at. The cluster hosts one of the largest giant radio halos which are observed in most of the merging clusters, and a candidate radio relic. Recently, three merger shock fronts were detected in this cluster, explaining its extreme temperature and complex structure. Furthermore, previousXMM-NewtonandChandraobservations hinted at the presence of a shock front that is associated with the gas ‘bullet’ crossing the main cluster in the west-ward direction, and which heated the intra-cluster medium, leading to adiabatic compression of the gas behind the ’bullet’. The goal of this paper is to report on the detection of this shock front as revealed by the temperature discontinuity in the X-ray XMM-Newton image, and the edge in the Very Large Array (VLA) radio image. We also report on the detection of a relic source in the north-eastern region of the radio halo in the KAT-7 data, confirming the presence of an extended relic in this cluster.The brightness edge in the X-rays corresponds to a shock front with a Mach number, at a distance of 0.2 Mpc from the cluster centre. An estimate from the luminosity jump gives. We consider a simple explanation for the electrons at the shock front, and for the observed discrepancy between the average spectral index of the radio halo emission and that predicted by theshock which precedes the ’bullet’.

We address, in particular, a characterization of such curves of minimal class and show that all realizations of these curves are essentially equivalent and can be described in terms of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC), also known as Szegő polynomials. Our results have connections to classical results from algebraic and projective geometry, such as theorems of Poncelet, Darboux, and Kippenhahn; numerical ranges of a class of matrices; and Blaschke products and disk functions.

These points form an abelian group, and we describe its structure. This structural description yields, almost immediately, an enumeration of the normalized pythagorean triples with a given hypotenuse, and also to an effective method for producing all such triples. This effective method seems to be new.

Motivated by the industrial processing of chocolate, we study experimentally the fluidisation of a sessile drop of yield-stress fluid on a pre-existing layer of the same fluid under vertical sinusoidal oscillations. We compare the behaviours of molten chocolate and Carbopol which are both shear-thinning with a similar yield stress but exhibit very different elastic properties. We find that these materials spread when the forcing acceleration exceeds a threshold which is determined by the initial deposition process. However, they exhibit very different spreading behaviours: whereas chocolate exhibits slow long-term spreading, the Carbopol drop rapidly relaxes its stress by spreading to a new equilibrium shape with an enlarged footprint. This spreading is insensitive to the history of the forcing. In addition, the Carbopol drop performs large-amplitude oscillations with the forcing frequency, both above and below the threshold. We investigate these viscoelastic oscillations and provide evidence of complex nonlinear viscoelastic behaviour in the vicinity of the spreading threshold. In fact, for forcing accelerations greater than the spreading threshold, our drop automatically adjusts its shape to remain at the yield stress. We discuss how our vibrated-drop experiment offers a new and powerful approach to probing the yield transition in elastoviscoplastic fluids.	
[2101.12169] Rate-Energy Balanced Precoding Design for SWIPT based Two-Way Relay Systems	Navneet Garg, Junkai Zhang, and Tharmalingam Ratnarajah	Authors are with Institute for Digital Communications The University of Edinburgh Edinburgh EH9 3FG UK (e-mails: {ngarg jzhang15 work was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under grant number EP/P009549/1.		Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technique is a popular strategy to convey both information and RF energy for harvesting at receivers. In this regard, we consider a two-way relay system with multiple users and a multi-antenna relay employing SWIPT strategy, where splitting the received signal leads to a rate-energy trade-off. In literature, the works on transceiver design have been studied using computationally intensive and suboptimal convex relaxation based schemes. In this paper, we study the balanced precoder design using chordal distance (CD) decomposition, which incurs much lower complexity, and is flexible to dynamic energy requirements. It is analyzed that given a non-negative value of CD, the achieved harvested energy for the proposed balanced precoder is higher than that for the perfect interference alignment (IA) precoder. The corresponding loss in sum rates is also analyzed via an upper bound. Simulation results add that the IA schemes based on mean-squared error are better suited for the SWIPT maximization than the subspace alignment-based methods.

The contamination by atmospheric muons in the final sample is suppressed at the level of a few per mill by different steps in the selection analysis, including a Boosted Decision Tree classifier. The distribution of reconstructed events is unfolded in terms of electron and muon neutrino fluxes. The derived energy spectra are compared with previous measurements that, above 100 GeV, are limited to experiments in polar ice and, for, to Super-Kamiokande.

[2101.12171] Optimal cost tuning of frustration: Achieving desired states in the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model	Gemma Rosell-Tarragó Albert Díaz-Guilera	de Física de la Matèria Condensada Universitat de Barcelona Martí Franquès 1 08028 Barcelona SpainUniversitat de Barcelona Institute of Complex Systems (UBICS) Martí Franquès 1 08028 Barcelona Spain	gemmaroselltarrago@gmail.com albert.diaz@ub.edu	There are numerous examples of studied real-world systems that can be described as dynamical systems characterized by individual phases and coupled in a network like structure. Within the framework of oscillatory models, much attention has been devoted to the Kuramoto model, which considers a collection of oscillators interacting through a sinus function of the phase differences. In this paper, we draw on an extension of the Kuramoto model, called the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model, which adds a phase lag parameter to each node. We construct a general formalism that allows to compute the set of lag parameters that may lead to any phase configuration within a linear approximation. In particular, we devote special attention to the cases of full synchronization and symmetric configurations. We show that the set of natural frequencies, phase lag parameters and phases at the steady state is coupled by an equation and a continuous spectra of solutions is feasible. In order to quantify the system’s strain to achieve that particular configuration, we define a cost function and compute the optimal set of parameters that minimizes it. Despite considering a linear approximation of the model, we show that the obtained tuned parameters for the case of full synchronization enhance frequency synchronization in the nonlinear model as well.	
[2101.12172] Vortex propagation and phase transitions in a chiral antiferromagnetic nanostripe	Riccardo Tomasello Stavros Komineas	Institute of Applied and Computational Mathematics FORTH Heraklion Crete Greece		We study a vortex in a nanostripe of an antiferromagnet with easy-plane anisotropy and interfacial Dzyloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The vortex has hybrid chirality being Néel close to its center and Bloch away from it. Propagating vortices can acquire velocities up to a maximum value that is lower than the spin wave velocity. When the vortex is forced to exceed the maximum velocity, phase transitions occur to a nonflat spiral, vortex chain, and flat spiral, successively. The vortex chain is a topological configuration stabilised in the stripe geometry. Theoretical arguments lead to the general result that the velocity of localized excitations in chiral magnets cannot reach the spin wave velocity.

Wyant College of Optical Sciences University of Arizona Tucson Arizona 85721 USA	zhuangquntao@email.arizona.edu	We solve the entanglement-assisted (EA) classical capacity region of quantum multiple-access channels with an arbitrary number of senders. As an example, we consider the bosonic thermal-loss multiple-access channel and solve the one-shot capacity region enabled by an entanglement source composed of sender-receiver pairwise two-mode squeezed vacuum states. The EA capacity region is strictly larger than the capacity region without entanglement-assistance. With two-mode squeezed vacuum states as the source and phase modulation as the encoding, we also design practical receiver protocols to realize the entanglement advantages. Four practical receiver designs, based on optical parametric amplifiers, are given and analyzed. In the parameter region of a large noise background, the receivers can enable a simultaneous rate advantage offor each sender. Due to teleportation and superdense coding, our results for EA classical communication can be directly extended to EA quantum communication at half of the rates. Our work provides a unique and practical network communication scenario where entanglement can be beneficial.

Given a text document as input, our core system identifies spans of textual entity and event mentions with a FrameNet(Baker et al.,1998)parser. It subsequently performs coreference resolution, fine-grained entity typing, and temporal relation prediction between events. By doing so, the system constructs an event and entity focused knowledge graph. We can further apply third-party modules for other types of annotation, like relation extraction. Our (multilingual) first-party modules either outperform or are competitive with the (monolingual) state-of-the-art. We achieve this through the use of multilingual encoders likeXLM-RConneau et al. (2020)and leveraging multilingual training data. LOME is available as a Docker container on Docker Hub. In addition, a lightweight version of the system is accessible as a web demo.	
[2101.12176] On the Origin of Implicit Regularization in Stochastic Gradient Descent	Samuel L. Smith, Benoit Dherin, David G. T. Barrettand Soham DeDeepMind,Google{slsmith, dherin,			For infinitesimal learning rates, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) follows the path of gradient flow on the full batch loss function. However moderately large learning rates can achieve higher test accuracies, and this generalization benefit is not explained by convergence bounds, since the learning rate which maximizes test accuracy is often larger than the learning rate which minimizes training loss. To interpret this phenomenon we prove that for SGD with random shuffling, the mean SGD iterate also stays close to the path of gradient flow if the learning rate is small and finite,but on a modified loss. This modified loss is composed of the original loss function and an implicit regularizer, which penalizes the norms of the minibatch gradients. Under mild assumptions, when the batch size is small the scale of the implicit regularization term is proportional to the ratio of the learning rate to the batch size. We verify empirically that explicitly including the implicit regularizer in the loss can enhance the test accuracy when the learning rate is small.

Our strategy is to view the B–model as a cycle of stacky projective lines and generalise the strategy of Lekili and Polishchuk in[LP17]to allow the irreducible components of the curve to have non-trivial generic stabiliser, a result which might also be of independent interest. We then prove that the A–model which results from this strategy is graded symplectomorphic to the corresponding quotient of the Milnor fibre.	
[2101.12179] Lévy Adaptive B-spline Regression via Overcomplete Systems	Sewon Park Hee-Seok Oh Jaeyong Lee	Department of Statistics Seoul National University		The estimation of functions with varying degrees of smoothness is a challenging problem in the nonparametric function estimation. In this paper, we propose the LABS (Lévy Adaptive B-Spline regression) model, an extension of the LARK models, for the estimation of functions with varying degrees of smoothness. LABS model is a LARK with B-spline bases as generating kernels. The B-spline basis consists of piecewisedegree polynomials withcontinuous derivatives and can express systematically functions with varying degrees of smoothness. By changing the orders of the B-spline basis, LABS can systematically adapt the smoothness of functions, i.e., jump discontinuities, sharp peaks, etc. Results of simulation studies and real data examples support that this model catches not only smooth areas but also jumps and sharp peaks of functions. The proposed model also has the best performance in almost all examples. Finally, we provide theoretical results that the mean function for the LABS model belongs to the certain Besov spaces based on the orders of the B-spline basis and that the prior of the model has the full support on the Besov spaces.

Chew	School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Purdue University West Lafayette IN 47907 USA	wcchew@purdue.edu	We present a new math-physics modeling approach, calledcanonical quantization with numerical mode-decomposition, for capturing the physics of how incoming photons interact with finite-sized dispersive media, which is not describable by the previous Fano-diagonalization methods. The main procedure is to (1) study a system where electromagnetic (EM) fields are coupled to non-uniformly-distributed Lorentz oscillators in Hamiltonian mechanics, (2) derive a generalized Hermitian eigenvalue problem for conjugate pairs in coordinate space, (3) apply computational electromagnetics methods to find a countably-finite set of time-harmonic eigenmodes that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian, and (4) perform the subsequent canonical quantization with mode-decomposition. Moreover, we provide several numerical simulations that capture the physics of full quantum effects, impossible by classical Maxwell’s equations, such as non-local dispersion cancellation of an entangled photon pair and Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect in a dispersive beam splitter.

The properties of biased tracers are described via a Lagrangian perturbative bias expansion which is advected to Eulerian space using the displacement field of numerical simulations. The cosmology-dependence is captured thanks to a cosmology-rescaling algorithm. We show that our emulator is capable of describing the power spectrum of galaxy formation simulations for a sample mimicking that of a typical Emission-Line survey atwith an accuracy ofup to nonlinear scales.	cosmology: theory – large-scale structure of Universe – methods: statistical – methods: computational
[2101.12188] Emergent gauge symmetries: Yang-Mills theory	Carlos Barceló Raúl Carballo-Rubio Luis J. Garay Gerardo García-Moreno	de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA-CSIC) Glorieta de la Astronomía 18008 Granada Spain	carlos@iaa.es raul.carballorubio@ucf.edu luisj.garay@ucm.es gerargar@ucm.es	Gauge symmetries remove unphysical states and guarantee that field theories are free from the pathologies associated with these states. In this work we find a set of general conditions that guarantee the removal of unphysical states in field theories describing interacting vector fields. These conditions are obtained through the extension of a mechanism for the emergence of gauge symmetries proposed in a previous article [C. Barcelóet al.JHEP 10 (2016) 084] in order to account for non-Abelian gauge symmetries, and are the following: low-energy Lorentz invariance, emergence of massless vector fields describable by an action quadratic in those fields and their derivatives, and self-coupling to a conserved current associated with specific rigid symmetries. Using a bootstrapping procedure, we prove that these conditions are equivalent to the emergence of gauge symmetries and, therefore, guarantee that any theory satisfying them must be equivalent to a Yang-Mills theory at low energies.

We find that the defects preserve only a part of thecurrent algebra symmetry.

[2101.12190] Practical distributed quantum information processing with LOCCNet	Xuanqiang Zhao Benchi Zhao Zihe Wang Zhixin Song Xin Wang	thanks:	wangxin73@baidu.com	Distributed quantum information processing is essential for building quantum networks and enabling more extensive quantum computations. In this regime, several spatially separated parties share a multipartite quantum system, and the most natural set of operations is Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). As a pivotal part in quantum information theory and practice, LOCC has led to many vital protocols such as quantum teleportation. However, designing practical LOCC protocols is challenging due to LOCC’s intractable structure and limitations set by near-term quantum devices. Here we introduce LOCCNet, a machine learning framework facilitating protocol design and optimization for distributed quantum information processing tasks. As applications, we explore various quantum information tasks such as entanglement distillation, quantum state discrimination, and quantum channel simulation. We discover protocols with evident improvements, in particular, for entanglement distillation with quantum states of interest in quantum information. Our approach opens up new opportunities for exploring entanglement and its applications with machine learning, which will potentially sharpen our understanding of the power and limitations of LOCC. An implementation of LOCCNet is available in Paddle Quantum, a quantum machine learning Python package based on PaddlePaddle deep learning platform.	
[2101.12191] Computer simulation of surgical interventions for the treatment of refractory pulmonary hypertension	Seong Woo Han Charles Puelz Craig G. Rusin Daniel J. Penny Ryan Coleman Charles S. Peskin	Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences New York UniversityDepartment of Bioengineering University of Pennsylvania		This paper describes computer models of three interventions used for treating refractory pulmonary hypertension (RPH). These procedures create either an atrial septal defect, a ventricular septal defect, or, in the case of a Potts shunt, a patent ductus arteriosus. The aim in all three cases is to generate a right-to-left shunt, allowing for either pressure or volume unloading of the right side of the heart in the setting of right ventricular failure, while maintaining cardiac output. These shunts are created, however, at the expense of introducing de-oxygenated blood into the systemic circulation, thereby lowering the systemic arterial oxygen saturation. The models developed in this paper are based on compartmental descriptions of human hemodynamics and oxygen transport. An important parameter included in our models is the cross-sectional area of the surgically created defect. Numerical simulations are performed to compare different interventions and various shunt sizes and to assess their impact on hemodynamic variables and oxygen saturations. We also create a model for exercise and use it to study exercise tolerance in simulated pre-intervention and post-intervention RPH patients.

[2101.12193] Quadratic estimators for CMB weak lensing	Abhishek S. Maniyar Yacine Ali-Haïmoud Julien Carron Antony Lewis Mathew S. Madhavacheril	for Cosmology and Particle Physics Department of Physics New York University New York NY 10003 USA	abhishek.maniyar@nyu.edu	In recent years, weak lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has emerged as a powerful tool to probe fundamental physics, such as neutrino masses, primordial non-Gaussianity, dark energy, and modified gravity. The prime target of CMB lensing surveys is the lensing potential, which is reconstructed from the observed CMB temperatureand polarizationandfields. Until very recently, this reconstruction has been performed with quadratic estimators (QEs), which, although known to be suboptimal for high-sensitivity experiments, are numerically efficient, and useful to make forecasts and cross-check the results of more sophisticated likelihood-based methods. It is expected that ongoing and near-future CMB experiments such as AdvACT, SPT-3G and the Simons Observatory (SO), will also rely on QEs. In this work, we review different QEs, and clarify and quantify their differences. In particular, we show that the Hu-Okamoto (HO02) estimator is not the absolute optimal lensing estimator that can be constructed out of quadratic combinations ofandfields. Instead, we derive the global-minimum-variance (GMV) lensing quadratic estimator. Although this estimator can be found elsewhere in the literature, it was erroneously described as equivalent to the HO02 estimator, and has never been used in real data analyses. Here, we show explicitly that the HO02 estimator is suboptimal to the GMV estimator, with a reconstruction noise larger by up tofor a SO-like experiment. We further show that the QE used in the Planck, and recent SPT lensing analysis is suboptimal to both the HO02 and GMV estimator, and would have a reconstruction noise up tolarger than that of the GMV estimator for a SO-like experiment. In addition to clarifying differences between different QEs, this work should thus provide motivation to implement the GMV estimator in future lensing analyses relying on QEs.

In PVG, we aim at allowing a user to control the generated video by selecting a discrete action at every time step as when playing a video game. The difficulty of the task lies both in learning semantically consistent actions and in generating realistic videos conditioned on the user input. We propose a novel framework for PVG that is trained in a self-supervised manner on a large dataset of unlabelled videos. We employ an encoder-decoder architecture where the predicted action labels act as bottleneck. The network is constrained to learn a rich action space using, as main driving loss, a reconstruction loss on the generated video. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several datasets with wide environment variety. Further details, code and examples are available on our project pagewilli-menapace.github.io/playable-video-generation-website.	
[2101.12196] Echoes of Compact Objects in Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity	Christoforos Vlachos, Eleftherios PapantonopoulosPhysics Division, National Technical University of Athens,15780 Zografou Campus, Athens, GreeceKyriakos DestounisTheoretical Astrophysics, IAAT, University of Tbingen, 72076 Tbingen, Germany		lpapa@central.ntua.grE kyriakos.destounis@uni-tuebingen.de cvlach@mail.ntua.grE	Scalar-tensor theory predicts solutions to the gravitational field equations which describe compact objects in the presence of a non-minimally coupled scalar field to the Einstein tensor. These objects are black holes with scalar hair and wormholes supporting scalar phantom matter. The evolution of test fields in fixed asymptotically-flat backgrounds of exotic compact objects leads to the formation of echoes in the ringdown signal, which designate the existence of trapping regions close to the event horizon. Here, we consider minimally-coupled test scalar fields propagating on compact object solutions of the Horndeski action, which possess an effective cosmological constant, leading to anti-de Sitter asymptotics, and show that echoes can form in the ringdown waveform due to the entrapment of test fields between the photon sphere and the effective asymptotic boundary. Although the presence of an event horizon leads to the usual echoes with decaying amplitude, signifying modal stability of the scalarized black hole considered, we find that test scalar fields propagating on a scalarized wormhole solution give rise to echoes of constant and equal amplitude to that of the initial ringdown, indicating the existence of normal modes. Finally, we find that, near extremality, the test field exhibits a concatenation of echoes; the primary ones are associated with the trapping region between the photon sphere and the effective anti-de Sitter boundary while the secondary ones are linked to the existence of a potential well at the throat of the wormhole.

We prove that the flow group is equal to the fundamental group of the component. As a corollary, we show that the plus and minus modular Rauzy–Veech groups are finite-index subgroups of their ambient modular monodromy groups. This partially answers a question of Yoccoz. Using this, and recent advances on algebraic hulls and Zariski closures of monodromy groups, we prove that the Rauzy–Veech groups are Zariski dense in their ambient symplectic groups. Density, in turn, implies the simplicity of the plus and minus Lyapunov spectra of any component of any stratum of quadratic differentials. Thus, we establish the Kontsevich–Zorich conjecture.

[2101.12198] A Spectral Approach to Polytope Diameter	Hariharan Narayanan111Supported by a Swarna Jayanti fellowshipTIFR Mumbai Rikhav ShahUC Berkeley Nikhil Srivastava222Supported by NSF Grants CCF-1553751 and CCF-2009011.UC Berkeley			We prove upper bounds on the graph diameters of polytopes in two settings. The first is a worst-case bound for polytopes defined by integer constraints in terms of the height of the integers and certain subdeterminants of the constraint matrix, which in some cases improves previously known results. The second is a smoothed analysis bound: given an appropriately normalized polytope, we add small Gaussian noise to each constraint. We consider a natural geometric measure on the vertices of the perturbed polytope (corresponding to the mean curvature measure of its polar) and show that with high probability there exists a “giant component” of vertices, with measureand polynomial diameter. Both bounds rely on spectral gaps — of a certain Schrödinger operator in the first case, and a certain continuous time Markov chain in the second — which arise from the log-concavity of the volume of a simple polytope in terms of its slack variables.

We found that in-plane magnetic fields beyond a critical value10 T are able to drastically enhanceat low temperatures, resulting in a double-peak structure ofthat closely resembles the behavior of-RuCl. This result suggests that heat transport in NaCoTeOis primarily phononic, and it is strongly affected by scattering from magnetic excitations that are highly tunable by external fields. Interestingly, for magnetic fields(i.e., along the zigzag direction of the Co-Co bonds), there is an extended field range which separates the long-range magnetic order forT and the partially spin-polarized gapped high-field phase forT. The low-energy phonon scattering is particularly strong in this field range, consistent with the notion that the system becomes a quantum spin liquid with prominent spin fluctuations down to energies of no more than 2 meV.	pacs:not needed

Simulations of the evolution of stellar streams in live-body halos without low-mass dark-matter subhalos, however, indicate that streams exhibit significant perturbations on small scales even in the absence of substructure. Here we demonstrate, using high-resolution-body simulations combined with sophisticated semi-analytic and simple analytic models, that the mass resolutions of–commonly used to perform such simulations cause spurious stream density variations with a similar magnitude on large scales as those expected from a CDM-like subhalo population and an order of magnitude larger on small, yet observable, scales. We estimate that mass resolutions of() are necessary for spurious, numerical density variations to be well below the CDM subhalo expectation on large (small) scales. That streams are sensitive to a simulation’s particle mass down to such small masses indicates that streams are sensitive to dark matter clustering down to these low masses if a significant fraction of the dark matter is clustered or concentrated in this way, for example, in MACHO models with masses of–.

Public social media platforms such as Twitter represent important sites of engagement regarding the pandemic and these data can be used by research teams for social, health, and other research. Understanding public opinion about COVID-19 and how information diffuses in social media is important for governments and research institutions. Twitter is a ubiquitous public platform and, as such, has tremendous utility for understanding public perceptions, behavior, and attitudes related to COVID-19. In this research, we present CML-COVID, a COVID-19 Twitter data set of 19,298,967 million tweets from 5,977,653 unique individuals and summarize some of the attributes of these data. These tweets were collected between March 2020 and July 2020 using the query terms ‘coronavirus’, ‘covid’ and ‘mask’ related to COVID-19.

[2101.12204] Federated Multi-Armed Bandits	Chengshuai Shi, Cong Shen			Federated multi-armed bandits (FMAB) is a new bandit paradigm that parallels the federated learning (FL) framework in supervised learning. It is inspired by practical applications in cognitive radio and recommender systems, and enjoys features that are analogous to FL. This paper proposes a general framework of FMAB and then studies two specific federated bandit models. We first study the approximate model where the heterogeneous local models are random realizations of the global model from an unknown distribution. This model introduces a new uncertainty ofclient sampling, as the global model may not be reliably learned even if the finite local models are perfectly known. Furthermore, this uncertainty cannot be quantifieda prioriwithout knowledge of the suboptimality gap. We solve the approximate model by proposing Federated Double UCB (Fed2-UCB), which constructs a novel “double UCB” principle accounting for uncertainties from both arm and client sampling. We show that gradually admitting new clients is critical in achieving anregret while explicitly considering the communication cost. The exact model, where the global bandit model is the exact average of heterogeneous local models, is then studied as a special case. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, the order-optimal regret can be achieved independent of the number of clients with a careful choice of the update periodicity. Experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the theoretical analysis and provide interesting insight into the proposed algorithms.

Due to the short event duration (days), the secondary object in this system could potentially be a massive giant planet. A Bayesian analysis shows that the system most likely consists of a host star with a massand a massive giant planet with a mass. However, the interpretation of the secondary as a planet (i.e., as having) rests entirely on the Bayesian analysis. Motivated by this event, we conduct an investigation to determine which constraints meaningfully affect Bayesian analyses for microlensing events. We find that the masses inferred from such a Bayesian analysis are determined almost entirely by the measured value ofand are relatively insensitive to other factors such as the direction of the event, the lens-source relative proper motion, or the specific Galactic model prior.

A bead-spring model where beads (masses) are connected by springs is considered, and it is used as a model of polymers. The QE lasts for a long time because the energy exchange between the high-frequency vibrational and other motions is prevented when springs in the molecule become stiff. We numerically calculated the time-averaged kinetic energy and found that the kinetic energy of the solvent particles was always higher than that of the bead in a molecule. This is explained by adapting the equipartition theorem in QE, and it agrees well with the numerical results. The energy difference can help determine how far the system is from achieving equilibrium, and it can be used as an indicator of the number of frozen or inactive degrees exist in the molecule.

Contrasting integrated star formation rates (SFRs), we find that the slope and normalization of the star-forming main sequence in TNG50 are quantitatively consistent with values derived by fitting observations from 3D-HST with theProspectorBayesian inference framework. The previous offsets of 0.2-1 dex between observed and simulated main sequence normalizations are resolved when using the updated masses and SFRs fromProspector. The scatter is generically smaller in TNG50 than in 3D-HST for more massive galaxies with MM, even after accounting for observational uncertainties. When comparing resolved star formation, we also find good agreement between TNG50 and 3D-HST: average specific star formation rate (sSFR) radial profiles of galaxies at all masses and radii below, on, and above the SFMS are similar in both normalization andshape. Most noteworthy, massive galaxies with MM, which have fallen below the SFMS due to ongoing quenching, exhibit a clear central SFR suppression, in both TNG50 and 3D-HST. In TNG this inside-out quenching is due to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback model operating at low accretion rates. In contrast, the original Illustris simulation, without this same physical SMBH mechanism, does not reproduce the central SFR profile suppression seen in data. The observed sSFR profiles provide support for the TNG quenching mechanism and how it affects gas on kiloparsec scales in the centers of galaxies.	galaxies: evolution – galaxies: formation – galaxies: high-redshift – galaxies: star formation – galaxies: structure
[2101.12213] Celestial-Body Focused Dark Matter Annihilation Throughout the Galaxy	Rebecca K. Leane Tim Linden Payel Mukhopadhyay Natalia Toro	thanks:	rleane@slac.stanford.edu payelmuk@stanford.edu ntoro@slac.stanford.edu linden@fysik.su.se	Indirect detection experiments typically measure the flux of annihilating dark matter (DM) particles propagating freely through galactic halos. We consider a new scenario where celestial bodies “focus” DM annihilation events, increasing the efficiency of halo annihilation. In this setup, DM is first captured by celestial bodies, such as neutron stars or brown dwarfs, and then annihilates within them. If DM annihilates to sufficiently long-lived particles, they can escape and subsequently decay into detectable radiation. This produces a distinctive annihilation morphology, which scales as the product of the DM and celestial body densities, rather than as DM density squared. We show that this signal can dominate over the halo annihilation rate in-ray observations in both the Milky Way Galactic center and globular clusters. We useFermiand H.E.S.S. data to constrain the DM-nucleon scattering cross section, setting powerful new limits down tocmfor sub-GeV DM using brown dwarfs, which is up to nine orders of magnitude stronger than existing limits. We demonstrate that neutron stars can set limits for TeV-scale DM down to aboutcm.	
[2101.12214] Multimessenger signals from black hole-neutron star mergers without significant tidal disruption	William E. East Luis Lehner Steven L. Liebling Carlos Palenzuela	Perimeter Institute 31 Caroline Street Waterloo ON N2L 2Y5 Canada		We study the multimessenger signals from the merger of a black hole with a magnetized neutron star using resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulations coupled to full general relativity. We focus on a case with a 5:1 mass ratio, where only a small amount of the neutron star matter remains post-merger, but we nevertheless find that significant electromagnetic radiation can be powered by the interaction of the neutron star’s magnetosphere with the black hole. In the lead-up to merger, strong twisting of magnetic field lines from the inspiral leads to plasmoid emission and results in a luminosity in excess of that expected from unipolar induction. We find that the strongest emission occurs shortly after merger during a transitory period in which magnetic loops form and escape the central region. The remaining magnetic field collimates around the spin axis of the remnant black hole before dissipating, an indication that, in more favorable scenarios (higher black hole spin/lower mass ratio) with larger accretion disks, a jet would form.

MW/M31-like analogues are defined as disky galaxies with stellar masses ofin relative isolation at. By defining satellites as galaxies withwithin(3D) of their host, we find a remarkable level of diversity and host-to-host scatter across individual host galaxies. The median TNG50 MW/M31-like galaxy hosts a total ofsatellites with, reaching up to. Even at a fixed host halo mass of, the total number of satellites ranges between. The abundance of subhaloes withis larger by a factor of more than 10. The number of all satellites (subhaloes) ever accreted is larger by a factor of() than those surviving to. Hosts with larger galaxy stellar mass, brighter-band luminosity, more recent halo assembly, and – most significantly – larger total halo mass typically have a larger number of surviving satellites. The satellite abundances around TNG50 MW/M31-like galaxies are consistent with those of mass-matched hosts from observational surveys (e.g. SAGA) and previous simulations (e.g. Latte). While the observed MW satellite system falls within the TNG50 scatter across all stellar masses considered, M31 is slightly more satellite-rich than ourscatter but well consistent with the high-mass end of the TNG50 sample. We find a handful of systems with both a Large and a Small Magellanic Cloud-like satellite. There is no missing satellites problem according to TNG50.	galaxies: dwarf – galaxies: haloes – galaxies: luminosity function | mass function – Local Group – Galaxy: formation – Galaxy: evolution
[2101.12216] Accreted or Not Accreted? The Fraction of Accreted Mass in Galaxies from Simulations and Observations	Rhea-Silvia Remusand Duncan A. ForbesUniversitäts-Sternwarte München, Fakultät für Physik, LMU München, Scheinerstr. 1, D-81679 München, GermanyCentre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn VIC 3122, Australia	E-mail:	rhea@usm.lmu.de	In the two-phase scenario of galaxy formation, a galaxy’s stellar mass growth is first dominated by in-situ star formation, and subsequently by accretion. We analyse the radial distribution of the accreted stellar mass in500 galaxies from the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Magneticum. Generally, we find good agreement with other simulations in that higher mass galaxies have larger accreted fractions, but we predict higher accretion fractions for low-mass galaxies. Based on the radial distribution of the accreted and in-situ components, we define 6 galaxy classes, from completely accretion dominated to completely in-situ dominated, and measure the transition radii between in-situ and accretion-dominated regions for galaxies that have such a transition. About 70% of our galaxies have one transition radius. However, we also find about 10% of the galaxies to be accretion dominated everywhere, and about 13% to have two transition radii, with the centre and the outskirts both being accretion dominated. We show that these classes are strongly correlated with the galaxy merger histories, especially with the mergers’ cold gas fractions. We find high total in-situ (low accretion) fractions to be associated with smaller, lower mass galaxies, lower central dark matter fractions, and larger transition radii. Finally, we show that the dips in observed surface brightness profiles seen in many early-type galaxies donotcorrespond to the transition from in-situ to accretion-dominated regions, and any inferred mass fractions are not indicative of the true accreted mass. Instead, these dips contain information about the galaxies’ dry minor merger assembly history.	galaxies: structure – galaxies: evolution – galaxies: formation – methods: numerical – methods: observational
[2101.12217] Outflows, Shocks and Coronal Line Emission in a Radio-Selected AGN in a Dwarf Galaxy	Mallory Molina Amy E. Reines Jenny E. Greene Jeremy Darling James J. Condon	eXtreme Gravity Institute Department of Physics Montana State University Bozeman MT 59717 USA		Massive black holes (BHs) in dwarf galaxies can provide strong constraints on BH seeds, however reliably detecting them is notoriously difficult. High resolution radio observations were recently used to identify accreting massive BHs in nearby dwarf galaxies, with a significant fraction found to be non-nuclear. Here we present the first results of our optical follow-up of these radio-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies using integral field unit (IFU) data from Gemini-North. We focus on the dwarf galaxy J1220+3020, which shows no clear optical AGN signatures in its nuclear SDSS spectrum covering the radio source. With our new IFU data, we confirm the presence of an active BH via the AGN coronal line [FeX] and enhanced [OI] emission coincident with the radio source. Furthermore, we detect broad Hemission and estimate a BH mass of. We compare the narrow emission line ratios to standard BPT diagnostics and shock models. Spatially-resolved BPT diagrams show some AGN signatures, particularly in [OI]/H, but overall do not unambiguously identify the AGN. A comparison of our data to shock models clearly indicates shocked emission surrounding the AGN. The physical model most consistent with the data is an active BH with a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) that both photoionizes and shock-excites the surrounding gas. We conclude that feedback is important in radio-selected BHs in dwarf galaxies, and that radio surveys may probe a population of low accretion-rate BHs in dwarf galaxies that cannot be detected through optical surveys alone.	active galaxies – dwarf galaxies – low-luminosity active galactic nuclei – radio jets – black holes

To this aim, we couple the radiative transfer codeSKIRTto the output of the TNG50 simulation and measure the dust-continuum half-light radius of the modeled galaxies, assuming a Milky Way dust type and a metallicity dependent dust-to-metal ratio. The dust-continuum half-light radius at observed-frame 850m is up to75 per cent larger than the stellar half-mass radius, but significantly more compact than the observed-frame 1.6m (roughly corresponding to H-band) half-light radius, particularly towards high redshifts: the compactness compared to the 1.6m emission increases with redshift. This is driven by obscuration of stellar light from the galaxy centres, which increases the apparent extent of 1.6m disk sizes relative to that at 850m. The difference in relative extents increases with redshift because the observed-frame 1.6m emission stems from ever shorter wavelength stellar emission. These results suggest that the compact dust-continuum emission observed ingalaxies is not (necessarily) evidence of the buildup of a dense central stellar component. We also find that the dust-continuum half-light radius very closely follows the radius containing half the star formation in galaxies, indicating that single band dust-continuum emission is a good tracer of the location of (obscured) star formation. The dust-continuum emission is more compact than the Hmass (for galaxies at) and the underlying dust mass. The dust emission strongly correlates with locations with the highest dust temperatures, which do not need to be the locations where most Hand/or dust is located. The presented results are a common feature of main-sequence galaxies.	galaxies: evolution -– galaxies: ISM -– submillimetre: galaxies -– radiative transfer -– infrared: galaxies

The model is time-reversal invariant and realizes atopological insulator as a result of artificial gauge fields. We develop topological arguments to describe this system showing three inequivalent sites in a unit cell and a flat band in its energy spectrum in addition to the topological dispersive energy bands. We show the stability of the topological phase towards spin-flip processes and different types of on-site potentials. In particular, we also address the situation where on-site energies may differ inside a unit cell. Moreover, a staggered potential on the lattice may realize topological phases for the half-filled situation. Another interesting result is the occurrence of a topological phase for large on-site energies. To describe topological properties of the system we use a numerical approach based on the twisted boundary conditions and we develop a mathematical approach, related to smooth fields.	
[2101.12220] Neutron Stars Harboring a Primordial Black Hole: Maximum Survival Time	Thomas W. Baumgarte Stuart L. Shapiro	Department of Physics and Astronomy Bowdoin College Brunswick Maine 04011		We explore in general relativity the survival time of neutron stars that host an endoparasitic, possibly primordial, black hole at their center. Corresponding to the minimum steady-state Bondi accretion rate for adiabatic flow that we found earlier for stiff nuclear equations of state (EOSs), we derive analytically the maximum survival time after which the entire star will be consumed by the black hole. We also show that this maximum survival time depends only weakly on the stiffness for polytropic EOSs with, so that this survival time assumes a nearly universal value that depends on the initial black hole mass alone. Establishing such a value is important for constraining the contribution of primordial black holes in the mass rangeto the dark-matter content of the Universe.

However, the latter are naturally associated with the non-abelian algebra of quantum fields, while the former has been argued to define an abelian algebra of superselected observables associated with partition-function-like quantities at an asymptotic boundary. We resolve this apparent tension by pointing out a variety of discrete choices that must be made in constructing a Hilbert space from such path integrals, and arguing that the natural choices for quantum gravity differ from those used to construct QFTs. We focus on one-dimensional models of quantum gravity in order to make direct comparisons with worldline QFT. We also restrict attention to models in which worldlines do not split apart or join together.

Rarity Siddarth Koduru Joshi	thanks:	SK.Joshi@Bristol.ac.uk 20SK.Joshi@Bristol.ac.uk	The global interest in quantum networks stems from the security guaranteed by the laws of physics. Deploying quantum networks means facing the challenges of scaling up the physical hardware and, more importantly, of scaling up all other network layers and optimally utilising network resources. Here we consider two related protocols, their experimental demonstrations on an 8-user quantum network test-bed, and discuss their usefulness with the aid of example use cases. First, an authentication transfer protocol to manage a fundamental limitation of quantum communication – the need for a pre-shared key between every pair of users linked together on the quantum network. By temporarily trusting some intermediary nodes for a short period of time (35 min in our network), we can generate and distribute these initial authentication keys with a very high level of security. Second, when end users quantify their trust in intermediary nodes, our flooding protocol can be used to improve both end-to-end communication speeds and increase security against malicious nodes.

We show that the key factors determining the dwarfs’ SFHs are their status as central or satellite and their stellar mass, with centrals and more massive dwarfs assembling their stellar mass at later times on average compared to satellites and lower mass dwarfs. The satellites in our sample (in hosts of total mass) assembled 90 per cent of theirstellar massGyr ago, on average and within thepercentiles, while the centrals did so onlyGyr ago. TNG50 predicts a large diversity in SFHs for both centrals and satellites, so that the stacked cumulative SFHs are representative of the TNG50 dwarf populations only in an average sense and individual dwarfs can have significantly different cumulative SFHs. In the case of the satellites, dwarfs with the highest stellar mass to host mass ratios have the latest stellar mass assembly. Conversely, satellites at fixed stellar and host halo mass found closer to the cluster centre or accreted at earlier times show significantly earlier stellar mass assembly. These trends, as well as the shapes of the SFHs themselves, are a manifestation of the varying proportions within a given subsample of quenched vs. star-forming galaxies, which exhibit markedly distinct SFH shapes. We also find a subtle effect whereby satellite dwarfs in the most massive hosts atare more efficient, i.e. have higher SFRs, at early times, wellbeforefinal infall into theirhost, compared to a control sample of centrals mass-matched at the time of accretion. This suggests that the large-scale environment can have a mild effect even onfuturesatellites by providing the conditions for enhanced SF at early epochs. Our results are useful theoretical predictions for comparison to future resolved-stellar-population observations.	galaxies: dwarf – galaxies: stellar content – galaxies: evolution – Local Group – galaxies: groups: general – galaxies: clusters: general
[2101.12227] Distinctive class of dissipation-induced phase transitions and their universal characteristics	Matteo Soriente Toni L. Heugel Keita Arimitsu R. Chitra Oded Zilberberg	Institute for Theoretical Physics ETH Zurich 8093 Zürich Switzerland		Coupling a system to a nonthermal environment can profoundly affect the phase diagram of the closed system, giving rise to a special class of dissipation-induced phase transitions. Such transitions take the system out of its ground state and stabilize a higher-energy stationary state, rendering it the sole attractor of the dissipative dynamics. In this paper, we present a unifying methodology, which we use to characterize this ubiquitous phenomenology and its implications for the open system dynamics. Specifically, we analyze the closed system’s phase diagram, including symmetry-broken phases, and explore their corresponding excitations’ spectra. Opening the system, the environment can overwhelm the system’s symmetry-breaking tendencies, and changes its order parameter. As a result, isolated distinct phases of similar order become connected, and new phase-costability regions appear. Interestingly, the excitations differ in the newly connected regions through a change in their symplectic norm, which is robust to the introduction of dissipation. As a result, by tuning the system from one phase to the other across the dissipation-stabilized region, the open system fluctuations exhibit an exceptional point like scenario, where the fluctuations become overdamped, only to reappear with an opposite sign in the dynamical response function of the system. The overdamped region is also associated with squeezing of the fluctuations. We demonstrate the pervasive nature of such dissipation-induced phenomena in two prominent examples, namely, in parametric resonators and in light-matter systems. Our work draws a crucial distinction between quantum phase transitions and their zero-temperature open system counterparts.	
[2101.12228] Definitions of (super) angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes: Properties and applications to compact-binary mergers	Arwa Elhashash David A. Nichols	of Physics University of Virginia P.O. Box 400714 Charlottesville VA 22904-7414 USA	david.nichols@virginia.edu aze5tn@virginia.edu	The symmetries of asymptotically flat spacetimes in general relativity are given by the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, though there are proposed generalizations of its symmetry algebra. Associated with each symmetry is a charge and a flux, and the values of these charges and their changes can characterize a spacetime. The charges of the BMS group are relativistic angular momentum and supermomentum (which includes 4-momentum); the extensions of the BMS algebra also include generalizations of angular momentum called “super angular momentum.” Several different formalisms have been used to define angular momentum, and they produce nonequivalent expressions for the charge. It was shown recently that these definitions can be summarized in a two-parameter family of angular momenta, which we investigate in this paper. We find that requiring that the angular momentum vanishes in flat spacetime restricts the two parameters to be equal. If we do not require that the angular momentum agrees with a common Hamiltonian definition, then we are left with a one-parameter family of angular momenta that includes the definitions from the several different formalisms. We then also propose a similar two-parameter family of super angular momentum. We examine the effect of the free parameters on the values of the angular momentum and super angular momentum from nonprecessing binary-black-hole mergers. The definitions of angular momentum differ at a high post-Newtonian order for these systems, but only when the system is radiating gravitational waves (not before and after). The different super-angular-momentum definitions occur at lower orders, and there is a difference in the change of super angular momentum even after the gravitational waves pass, which arises because of the gravitational-wave memory effect. We estimate the size of these effects using numerical-relativity surrogate waveforms and find they are small but resolvable.	
[2101.12229] Dark acoustic oscillations: Imprints on the matter power spectrum and the halo mass function	Timothée Schaefferand Aurel SchneiderCenter for Theoretical Astrophysics and Cosmology, Institute for Computational Science, University of Zurich,Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057 Zürich, Switzerland	E-mail:	aurel.schneider@uzh.ch timothee.schaeffer@uzh.chE	Many non-minimal dark matter scenarios lead to oscillatory features in the matter power spectrum induced by interactions either within the dark sector or with particles from the standard model. Observing such dark acoustic oscillations would therefore be a major step towards understanding dark matter. We investigate what happens to oscillatory features during the process of nonlinear structure formation. We show that at the level of the power spectrum, oscillations are smoothed out by nonlinear mode coupling, gradually disappearing towards lower redshifts. In the halo mass function, however, the oscillatory features remain visible until the present epoch. As a consequence, dark acoustic oscillations could be detectable in observations that are either based on the halo mass function or on the high-redshift power spectrum. We investigate the effect of such features on different observables, namely, the cluster mass function, the stellar-to-halo mass relation, and the Lyman-flux power spectrum. We find that oscillatory features remain visible in all of these observables, but they are very extended and of low amplitude, making it challenging to detect them as distinct features in the data.	cosmology: dark matter - cosmology: large-scale structure of the Universe
[2101.12230] Mechanism for Strong Chimeras	Yuanzhao Zhang Adilson E. Motter	Department of Physics and Astronomy Northwestern University Evanston Illinois 60208 USA		Chimera states have attracted significant attention as symmetry-broken states exhibiting the unexpected coexistence of coherence and incoherence. Despite the valuable insights gained from analyzing specific systems, an understanding of the general physical mechanism underlying the emergence of chimeras is still lacking. Here, we show that many stable chimeras arise because coherence in part of the system is sustained by incoherence in the rest of the system. This mechanism may be regarded as a deterministic analog of noise-induced synchronization and is shown to underlie the emergence ofstrongchimeras. These are chimera states whose coherent domain is formed by identically synchronized oscillators. Recognizing this mechanism offers a new meaning to the interpretation that chimeras are a natural link between coherence and incoherence.

Rich Mark Seibert	Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics University of Chicago 5640 South Ellis Avenue Chicago IL 60637 USAThe Observatories of the Carnegie Institution for Science 813 Santa Barbara Street Pasadena CA 91101 USA		The primary goal of the Carnegie Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP) is to calibrate the zero-point of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) Hubble Diagram through the use of Population II standard candles. So far, the CCHP has measured direct distances to 11 SNe Ia, and here we increase that number to 15 with two new TRGB distances measured to NGC 5643 and NGC 1404, for a total of 20 SN Ia calibrators. We present resolved, point-source photometry from new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of these two galaxies in the F814W and F606W bandpasses. From each galaxy’s stellar halo, we construct an F814W-band luminosity function in which we detect an unambiguous edge feature identified as the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB). For NGC 5643, we find0.03(stat)0.07(sys) mag, and for NGC 1404 we find0.04(stat)0.05(sys) mag. From a preliminary consideration of the SNe Ia in these galaxies, we find increased confidence in the results presented in Paper VIII(Freedman et al.,2019). The high precision of our TRGB distances enables a significant measurement of the 3D displacement between the Fornax Cluster galaxies NGC 1404 and NGC 1316 (Fornax A) equal toMpc, which we show is in agreement with independent literature constraints.

Pando Zayas	institutetext:	jimliu@umich.edu agonzale@ictp.it lpandoz@umich.edu junhoh@umich.edu	We investigate the Bethe-Ansatz approach to the superconformal index ofsupersymmetric Yang-Mills with SU() gauge group in the context of finite rank,. We explicitly explore the role of the various types of solutions to the Bethe-Ansatz Equations in recovering the exact index for. We classify the Bethe-Ansatz Equations solutions as standard (corresponding to a freely acting orbifold) and non-standard. For, we find that the index is fully recovered by standard solutions and displays an interesting pattern of cancellations. However, for, the standard solutions alone do not suffice to reconstruct the index. We present quantitative arguments in various regimes of fugacities that highlight the challenging role played by the continuous families of non-standard solutions.

We reformulate this description as a gauge theory with one gauge field that is symmetric under exchange of indices and one that is not. We also show that topological defects in quasicrystals can be succinctly incorporated in the dual description and interpret them as fractonic excitations. Finally we calculate the static interaction potential between defects in a quasicrystal with fivefold symmetry. This is done in the limit of a small coupling between phonon and phason stresses.

In this work, we generalize the traditional capacity region by exploring communication rates achievable when some receivers are required to decode their information before others, at different predetermined times; referred here as thetime-rateregion. Through a reduction to the standard notion of capacity, we present an inner-bound on the time-rate region. The time-rate region has been previously studied and characterized for the memoryless broadcast channel (with a sole common message) under the namestatic broadcasting.

Perrin	Empa Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology Transport at Nanoscale Interfaces Laboratory Überlandstrasse 129 CH-8600 Dübendorf Switzerland	mickael.perrin@empa.ch	Mapping the thermal transport properties of materials at the nanoscale is of critical importance for optimizing heat conduction in nanoscale devices. Several methods to determine the thermal conductivity of materials have been developed, most of them yielding an average value across the sample, thereby disregarding the role of local variations. Here, we present a method for the spatially-resolved assessment of the thermal conductivity of suspended graphene by using a combination of confocal Raman thermometry and a finite-element calculations-based fitting procedure. We demonstrate the working principle of our method by extracting the two-dimensional thermal conductivity map of one pristine suspended single-layer graphene sheet and one irradiated using helium ions. Our method paves the way for spatially resolving the thermal conductivity of other types of layered materials. This is particularly relevant for the design and engineering of nanoscale thermal circuits (e.g. thermal diodes).	American Chemical Society | LATEX

Kochanek P. Schmeer K. Z. Stanek K. Mukai B. Shappee Z. Way C. Basinger T. W.-S. Holoien J. L. Prieto	Center for Data Intensive and Time Domain Astronomy Department of Physics and Astronomy Michigan State University East Lansing MI 48824 USA		The unprecedented sky coverage and observing cadence of the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) has resulted in the discovery and continued monitoring of a large sample of Galactic transients. The vast majority of these are accretion-powered dwarf nova outbursts in cataclysmic variable systems, but a small subset are thermonuclear-powered classical novae. Despite improved monitoring of the Galaxy for novae from ASAS-SN and other surveys, the observed Galactic nova rate is still lower than predictions. One way classical novae could be missed is if they are confused with the much larger population of dwarf novae. Here, we examine the properties of 1617 dwarf nova outbursts detected by ASAS-SN and compare them to classical novae. We find that the mean classical nova brightens by11 magnitudes during outburst, while the mean dwarf nova brightens by only5 magnitudes, with the outburst amplitude distributions overlapping by roughly 15. For the first time, we show that the amplitude of an outburst and the time it takes to decline by two magnitudes from maximum are positively correlated for dwarf nova outbursts. For classical novae, we find that these quantities are negatively correlated, but only weakly, compared to the strong anti-correlation of these quantities found in some previous work. We show that, even if located at large distances, only a small number of putative dwarf novae could be mis-classified classical novae suggesting that there is minimal confusion between these populations. Future spectroscopic follow-up of these candidates can show whether any are indeed classical novae.

Bekris	The first three authors contributed equally to this paper. The authors are with the Dept. of Computer Science Rutgers Univ. NJ. Email:{rw485 kg627 dn332 jy512 The work is supported in part by NSF awards IIS-1845888 NRI-1734492 CCF-1934924 and an NSF NRT project 2021628.		Object rearrangement is a widely-applicable and challenging task for robots. Geometric constraints must be carefully examined to avoid collisions and combinatorial issues arise as the number of objects increases. This work studies the algorithmic structure of rearranging uniform objects, where robot-object collisions do not occur but object-object collisions have to be avoided. The objective is minimizing the number of object transfers under the assumption that the robot can manipulate one object at a time. An efficiently computable decomposition of the configuration space is used to create a “region graph”, which classifies all continuous paths of equivalent collision possibilities. Based on this compact but rich representation, a complete dynamic programming primitiveperforms a recursive depth first search to solve monotone problems quickly, i.e., those instances that do not require objects to be moved first to an intermediate buffer.is extended to solve single-buffer, non-monotone instances, given a choice of an object and a buffer. This work utilizes these primitives as local planners in an informed search framework for more general, non-monotone instances. The search utilizes partial solutions from the primitives to identify the most promising choice of objects and buffers. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution returns near-optimal paths with higher success rate, even for challenging non-monotone instances, than other leading alternatives.	
[2101.12242] D3DLO: Deep 3D LiDAR Odometry				LiDAR odometry (LO) describes the task of finding an alignment of subsequent LiDAR point clouds. This alignment can be used to estimate the motion of the platform where the LiDAR sensor is mounted on. Currently, on the well-known KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite state-of-the-art algorithms are non-learning approaches. We propose a network architecture that learns LO by directly processing 3D point clouds. It is trained on the KITTI dataset in an end-to-end manner without the necessity of pre-defining corresponding pairs of points. An evaluation on the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite shows similar performance to a previously published work, DeepCLR[1], even though our model uses only around 3.56% of the number of network parameters thereof. Furthermore, a plane point extraction is applied which leads to a marginal performance decrease while simultaneously reducing the input size by up to 50%.

Neglecting gravitational effects, we consider the formal asymptotic limit of small film heights in the two-phase Navier–Stokes system. This leads to a strongly coupled system of two parabolic equations of fourth order with merely Hölder-continuous dependence on the coefficients. For the case of strictly positive initial film heights we prove local existence of strong solutions by abstract semigroup theory. Uniqueness is proved by energy methods. Under additional regularity assumptions, we investigate asymptotic stability of the unique equilibrium solution, which is given by constant film heights.	
[2101.12244] Certifying Numerical Decompositions of Compact Group Representations	Felipe Montealegre-Mora Denis Rosset Jean-Daniel Bancal David Gross	Institute of Theoretical Physics University of Cologne Germany		We present a performant and rigorous algorithm for certifying that a matrix is close to being a projection onto an irreducible subspace of a given group representation. This addresses a problem arising when one seeks solutions to semi-definite programs (SDPs) with a group symmetry. Indeed, in this context, the dimension of the SDP can be significantly reduced if the irreducible representations of the group action are explicitly known. Rigorous numerical algorithms for decomposing a given group representation into irreps are known, but fairly expensive. To avoid this performance problem, existing software packages – e.g. RepLAB, which motivated the present work – use randomized heuristics. While these seem to work well in practice, the problem of to which extent the results can be trusted arises. Here, we provide rigorous guarantees applicable to finite and compact groups, as well as a software implementation that can interface with RepLAB. Under natural assumptions, a commonly used previous method due to Babai and Friedl runs in timefor-dimensional representations. In our approach, the complexity of running both the heuristic decomposition and the certification step is, whereis the maximum dimension of an irreducible subrepresentation, andis the time required to multiply elements of the group. A reference implementation interfacing with RepLAB is provided.

Primary 03E04, 03E45, 03E55	Dominik Adolf and Omer Ben-Neria			Shelah showed that the existence of free subsets over internally approachable subalgebras follows from the failure of the PCF conjecture on intervals of regular cardinals. We show that a stronger property called the Approachable Bounded Subset Property can be forced from the assumption of a cardinalfor which the set of Mitchell ordersis unbounded in. Furthermore, we study the related notion of continuous tree-like scales, and show that such scales must exist on all products in canonical inner models. We use this result, together with a covering-type argument, to show that the large cardinal hypothesis from the forcing part is optimal.	
[2101.12246] Revisiting Non-Specific Syndromic Surveillance	Moritz Kulessa Eneldo Loza Mencía Johannes Fürnkranz	institutetext:	juffi@faw.jku.at	Infectious disease surveillance is of great importance for the prevention of major outbreaks. Syndromic surveillance aims at developing algorithms which can detect outbreaks as early as possible by monitoring data sources which allow to capture the occurrences of a certain disease. Recent research mainly focuses on the surveillance of specific, known diseases, putting the focus on the definition of the disease pattern under surveillance. Until now, only little effort has been devoted to what we callnon-specificsyndromic surveillance, i.e., the use of all available data for detecting any kind of outbreaks, including infectious diseases which are unknown beforehand. In this work, we revisit published approaches for non-specific syndromic surveillance and present a set of simple statistical modeling techniques which can serve as benchmarks for more elaborate machine learning approaches. Our experimental comparison on established synthetic data and real data in which we injected synthetic outbreaks shows that these benchmarks already achieve very competitive results and often outperform more elaborate algorithms.

In the meantime, vehicular environment radio propagation is negatively influenced by a large set of objects that cause transmission distortion such as high buildings. Therefore, this work is devoted to explore the area of RIS technology integration with vehicular communications while considering the dynamic nature of such communication environment. Specifically, we provide a system model where RoadSide Unit (RSU) leverages RIS to provide indirect wireless transmissions to disconnected areas, known as dark zones. Dark zones are spots within RSU coverage where the communication links are blocked due to the existence of blockages. In details, a discrete RIS is utilized to provide communication links between the RSU and the vehicles passing through out-of-service zones. Therefore, the joint problem of RSU resource scheduling and RIS passive beamforming or phase-shift matrix is formulated as an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the minimum average bit rate. The formulated problem is mixed integer non-convex program which is difficult to be solved and does not account for the uncertain dynamic environment in vehicular networks. Thereby, we resort to alternative methods based on Deep Reinforcement Learning to determine RSU wireless scheduling and Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) to solve for the phase-shift matrix,i.e.,passive beamforming, of the RIS. The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is defined and the complexity of the solution approach is discussed. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over baseline techniques.

[2101.12249] A Survey of Complex-Valued Neural Networks	Joshua Bassey, Xiangfang Li, Lijun Qian	Center of Excellence in Research and Education for Big Military Data Intelligence (CREDIT)Department of Electrical and Computer EngineeringPrairie View A&M University Texas A&M University SystemPrairie View TX 77446 USAEmail:	liqian@pvamu.edu jbassey@student.pvamu.edu xili@pvamu.edu	Artificial neural networks (ANNs) based machine learning models and especially deep learning models have been widely applied in computer vision, signal processing, wireless communications, and many other domains, where complex numbers occur either naturally or by design. However, most of the current implementations of ANNs and machine learning frameworks are using real numbers rather than complex numbers. There are growing interests in building ANNs using complex numbers, and exploring the potential advantages of the so called complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) over their real-valued counterparts. In this paper, we discuss the recent development of CVNNs by performing a survey of the works on CVNNs in the literature. Specifically, detailed review of various CVNNs in terms of activation function, learning and optimization, input and output representations, and their applications in tasks such as signal processing and computer vision are provided, followed by a discussion on some pertinent challenges and future research directions.	complex-valued neural networks; complex number; machine learning; deep learning
[2101.12250] The MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey XVI. The angular momentum of low-mass star-forming galaxies. A cautionary tale and insights from TNG50This study is based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under ESO programmes 094.A-0289, 095.A-0010 and 096.A-0045.	Nicolas F. Bouché Shy Genel Alisson Pellissier Cédric Dubois Thierry Contini Benoît Epinat Annalisa Pillepich Davor Krajnović Dylan Nelson Valentina Abril-Melgarejo Johan Richard Leindert Boogaard Michael Maseda Wilfried Mercier Roland Bacon Matthias Steinmetz Mark Vogelsberger	institutetext:	nicolas.bouche@univ-lyon1.fr	We investigate the specific angular momentum (sAM)profiles of intermediate redshift () star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the relatively unexplored regime of low masses (down to) and small sizes (down tokpc), and we characterize the sAM scaling relation (i.e., Fall relation) and its redshift evolution. We have developed a 3D methodology to constrain sAM profiles of the star-forming gas using a forward modeling approach withGalPaKthat incorporates the effects of beam smearing, yielding the intrinsic morpho-kinematic properties even with limited spatial resolution data. Using mock observations from the TNG50 simulation, we find that our 3D methodology robustly recovers the star formation rate (SFR)-weightedprofiles down to a low effective signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of. We applied our methodology blindly to a sample of 494[Oii]-selected SFGs in the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (UDF) 9 arcminmosaic data, covering the unexploredmass range. We find that the (SFR-weighted) sAM relation followswith an indexvarying fromto, fromto. The UDF sample supports a redshift evolution, withwhich is consistent with theexpectation from a universe in expansion. The scatter of the sAM sequence is a strong function of the dynamical state with, whereis the velocity dispersion at. In TNG50, SFGs also form aplane, but it correlates more with galaxy size than with morphological parameters. Our results suggest that SFGs might experience a dynamical transformation, and lose their sAM, before their morphological transformation to becoming passive via either merging or secular evolution.

[2101.12251] Finite-temperature, Anharmonicity, and Duschinsky Effects on the Two-dimensional Electronic Spectra from Ab Initio Thermo-field Gaussian Wavepacket Dynamics	Tomislav Begušić Jiří Vaníček		tomislav.begusic@epfl.ch jiri.vanicek@epfl.ch	Accurate description of finite-temperature vibrational dynamics is indispensable in the computation of two-dimensional electronic spectra. Such simulations are often based on the density matrix evolution, statistical averaging of initial vibrational states, or approximate classical or semiclassical limits. While many practical approaches exist, they are often of limited accuracy and difficult to interpret. Here, we use the concept of thermo-field dynamics to derive an exact finite-temperature expression that lends itself to an intuitive wavepacket-based interpretation. Furthermore, an efficient method for computing finite-temperature two-dimensional spectra is obtained by combining the exact thermo-field dynamics approach with the thawed Gaussian approximation for the wavepacket dynamics, which is exact for any displaced, distorted, and Duschinsky-rotated harmonic potential but also accounts partially for anharmonicity effects in general potentials. Using this new method, we directly relate a symmetry breaking of the two-dimensional signal to the deviation from the conventional Brownian oscillator picture.

Villanueva		mohsen.fathi@postgrado.uv.cl jose.villanueva@uv.cl martin.molina.r@mail.pucv.cl	In this letter we use the Carathéodory’s approach to thermodynamics, to construct the thermodynamic manifold of the Hayward black hole. The Pfaffian form representing the infinitesimal heat exchange reversibly is considered to be, previously obtained by Molina & VillanuevaM. Molina and J.R. Villanueva (2021), whereis the Schwarzschild radius,is the Hayward’s parameter responsible for the possible regularization of the Schwarzschild black hole, andis the intensive variable called the Hayward’s force. By solving the associated Cauchy problem, the adiabatic paths are confined to the non-extremal manifold, and therefore, the status of the second and third laws are preserved. Consequently, the extremal sub-manifold corresponds to the adiabatically disconnected boundary of the manifold. In addition, the merger of two extremal Hayward black holes is analyzed.

[2101.12254] Reliable COVID-19 Detection using Chest X-Ray Images				Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged the need for computer-aided diagnosis with automatic, accurate, and fast algorithms. Recent studies have applied Machine Learning algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis over chest X-ray (CXR) images. However, the data scarcity in these studies prevents a reliable evaluation with the potential of overfitting and limits the performance of deep networks. Moreover, these networks can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia usually from healthy subjects only or occasionally, from limited pneumonia types. Thus, there is a need for a robust and accurate COVID-19 detector evaluated over a large CXR dataset. To address this need, in this study, we propose a reliable COVID-19 detection network: ReCovNet, which can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia from 14 different thoracic diseases and healthy subjects. To accomplish this, we have compiled the largest COVID-19 CXR dataset: QaTa-COV19 with 124,616 images including 4603 COVID-19 samples. The proposed ReCovNet achieved a detection performance with 98.57% sensitivity and 99.77% specificity.	
[2101.12255] Hybrid leg compliance enables robots to operate with sensorimotor delays and low control update frequencies	Milad Shafiee Ashtiani, Alborz Aghamaleki Sarvestaniand Alexander Badri-Spröwitz			Animals locomote robustly and agile, albeit significant sensorimotor delays of their nervous system. The sensorimotor control of legged robots is implemented with much higher frequencies— often in the kilohertz range—and sensor and actuator delays in the low millisecond range. But especially at harsh impacts with unknown touch-down timing, legged robots show unstable controller behaviors, while animals are seemingly not impacted. Here we examine this discrepancy and suggest a hybrid robotic leg and controller design. We implemented a physical, parallel joint compliance dimensioned in combination with an active, virtual leg length controller. We present an extensive set of systematic experiments both in computer simulation and hardware. Our hybrid leg and controller design shows previously unseen robustness, in the presence of sensorimotor delays up to 60 ms, or control frequencies as low as 20 Hz, for a drop landing task from 1.3 leg lengths high and with a passive compliance ratio of 0.7. In computer simulations, we report successful drop-landings of the hybrid compliant leg from 3.8 leg lengths (1.2 m) for a 2 kg quadruped robot with 100 Hz control frequency and a sensorimotor delay of 35 ms. The results of our presented hybrid leg design and control provide a further explanation for the performance robustness of animals, and the resulting discrepancy between animals and legged robots.\helveticabold

In order to perform chemotaxis, i.e. to move towards and to stay at high concentrations of nutrients, they adapt their swimming gaits in a nontrivial manner. We propose a model how microswimmers are able to autonomously adapt their shape in order to swimin one dimensiontowards high field concentrations using an internal decision making machinery modeled by an artificial neural network. We present two methods to measure chemical gradients, spatial and temporal sensing, as known for swimming mammalian cells and bacteria, respectively.Using the NEAT genetic algorithm surprisingly simple neural networks evolve which control the shape deformations of the microswimmer and allow them to navigate in static and complex time-dependent chemical environments.Byintroducingnoisy signal transmission in the neural network the well-known biased run-and-tumble motion emerges. Our work demonstrates that the evolution of a simple internal decision-making machinery, which we can fully interpret and is coupled to the environment, allows navigation in diverse chemical landscapes. These findings are of relevance for intracellular biochemical sensing mechanisms of single cells, or for the simple nervous system of small multicellular organisms such asC. elegans.

We conclude with a question and a conjecture about reducible surgeries.	Key words and phrases:exceptional surgeries | toroidal fillings | knots in handlebodies

Michael Fall	Department of Physics & Astronomy The University of Toledo Toledo OH 43606 USA		We derive the mass-radius relation and mass function of molecular clumps in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and interpret them in terms of the simple feedback model proposed by Fall, Krumholz, and Matzner (FKM). Our work utilizes the dendrogram-based catalog of clumps compiled by Wong et al. fromCO andCO maps of six giant molecular clouds in the LMC observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The Magellanic Clouds are the only external galaxies for which this type of analysis is possible at the necessary spatial resolution (pc). We find that the mass-radius relation and mass function of LMC clumps have power-law forms,and, with indicesandover the mass rangesand, respectively. With these values ofandfor the clumps (i.e., protoclusters), the predicted index for the mass function of young LMC clusters from the FKM model is, in good agreement with the observed index. The situation portrayed here for clumps and clusters in the LMC replicates that in the Milky Way.

Our full-scale analysis yields constraints on the growth of structure that are a factor of two more stringent than any other study on large scales at similar redshifts. We inferat, andat; the correspondingCDM predictions of the Planck CMB analysis areand, respectively. Our results are thus consistent with Planck, but also follow the trend seen in previous low-redshift measurements offalling slightly below theCDM+CMB prediction. We find that small and large radial scales yield mutually consistent values of, but there arehints of small scales () preferring lower values forrelative to larger scales. We analyse the constraining power of the full range of radial scales, finding that most of the multipole information aboutis contained in the scales. Evidently, once the cosmological information of the quasi-to-nonlinear regime has been harvested, large-scale modes contain only modest additional information about structure growth. Finally, we compare predictions for the galaxy–galaxy lensing amplitude of the two samples against measurements from SDSS and assess the lensing-is-low effect in light of our findings.	cosmology: large-scale structure of Universe – cosmology: cosmological parameters – cosmology: dark matter
[2101.12262] Measuring non-exchangeable tail dependence using tail copulas	Takaaki Koike111Corresponding author;  Shogo Kato Marius Hofert	Risk Analysis Research Center Institute of Statistical Mathematics Tachikawa Tokyo 190-8562 Japan	tkoike@ism.ac.jp	Quantifying tail dependence is an important issue in insurance and risk management. The prevalent tail dependence coefficient (TDC), however, is known to underestimate the degree of tail dependence and it does not capture non-exchangeable tail dependence since it evaluates the limiting tail probability only along the main diagonal. To overcome these issues, two novel tail dependence measures called the maximal tail concordance measure (MTCM) and the average tail concordance measure (ATCM) are proposed. Both measures are constructed based on tail copulas and possess clear probabilistic interpretations in that the MTCM evaluates the largest limiting probability among all comparable rectangles in the tail, and the ATCM is a normalized average of these limiting probabilities. In contrast to the TDC, the proposed measures can capture non-exchangeable tail dependence. Moreover, they often admit analytical forms and satisfy axiomatic properties naturally required to quantify tail dependence. A real data analysis reveals striking tail dependence and tail non-exchangeability of the return series of stock indices, particularly in periods of financial distress.

[2101.12266] Detecting violations of macrorealism when the original Leggett-Garg inequalities are satisfied	Shayan Majidy Jonathan J. Halliwell Raymond Laflamme	for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics and Astronomy University of Waterloo Waterloo Ontario N2L 3G1 Canada	smajidy@uwaterloo.ca	Macroscopic realism (MR) is the notion that a time-evolving system possesses definite properties, irrespective of past or future measurements. Quantum mechanical theories can, however, produce violations of MR. Most research to date has focused on a single set of conditions for MR, the Leggett-Garg inequalities (LGIs), and on a single data set, the “standard data set”, which consists of single-time averages and second-order correlators of a dichotomic variable Q for three times. However, if such conditions are all satisfied, then where is the quantum behavior? In this paper, we provide an answer to this question by considering expanded data sets obtained from finer-grained measurements and MR conditions on those sets. We consider three different situations in which there are violations of MR that go undetected by the standard LGIs. First, we explore higher-order LGIs on a data set involving third- and fourth-order correlators, using a spin-1/2 and spin-1 system. Second, we explore the pentagon inequalities (PIs) and a data set consisting of all possible averages and second-order correlators for measurements of Q at five times. Third, we explore the LGIs for a trichotomic variable and measurements made with a trichotomic operator to, again, identify violations for a spin-1 system beyond those seen with a single dichotomic variable. We also explore the regimes in which combinations of two and three-time LGIs can be satisfied and violated in a spin-1 system, extending recent work. We discuss the possible experimental implementation of all the above results.	
[2101.12267] A Bayesian Model of Cash Bail Decisions	Joshua Williams J. Zico Kolter	Computer Science Department and Carnegie Mellon University	jnwillia@cs.cmu.edu zkolter@cs.cmu.edu	The use of cash bail as a mechanism for detaining defendants pre-trial is an often-criticized system that many have argued violates the presumption of “innocent until proven guilty.” Many studies have sought to understand both the long-term effects of cash bail’s use and the disparate rate of cash bail assignments along demographic lines (race, gender, etc). However, such work is often susceptible to problems of infra-marginality – that the data we observe can only describe average outcomes, and not the outcomes associated with the marginal decision. In this work, we address this problem by creating a hierarchical Bayesian model of cash bail assignments. Specifically, our approach models cash bail decisions as a probabilistic process whereby judges balance the relative costs of assigning cash bail with the cost of defendants potentially skipping court dates, and where these skip probabilities are estimated based upon features of the individual case. We then use Monte Carlo inference to sample the distribution over these costs for different magistrates and across different races. We fit this model to a data set we have collected of over 50,000 court cases in the Allegheny and Philadelphia counties in Pennsylvania. Our analysis of 50 separate judges shows that they areuniformlymore likely to assign cash bail to black defendants than to white defendants, even given identical likelihood of skipping a court appearance. This analysis raises further questions about the equity of the practice of cash bail, irrespective of its underlying legal justification.	Infra-marginality; Hierarchical Bayesian Model; Cash Bail

[2101.12269] Prospects for Detecting Gravitational Waves from Eccentric Subsolar Mass Compact Binaries	Yi-Fan Wang  Alexander H. Nitz	Max-Planck-Institut für Gravitationsphysik (Albert-Einstein-Institut) D-30167 Hannover GermanyLeibniz Universität Hannover D-30167 Hannover Germany		Due to their small mass, subsolar mass black hole binaries would have to be primordial in origin instead of the result of stellar evolution. Soon after formation in the early universe, primordial black holes can form binaries after decoupling from the cosmic expansion. Alternatively, primordial black holes as dark matter could also form binaries in the late universe due to dynamical encounters and gravitational-wave braking. A significant feature for this channel is the possibility that some sources retain nonzero eccentricity in the LIGO/Virgo band. Assuming all dark matter is primordial black holes with a delta function mass distribution,binaries formed in this late-universe channel can be detected by Advanced LIGO and Virgo with their design sensitivities at a rate of/year, whereof events have eccentricity at a gravitational-wave frequency of 10 Hz,, and nondetection can constrain the binary formation rate within this model. Third generation detectors would be expected to detect subsolar mass eccentric binaries as light aswithin this channel, if they accounted for the majority of the dark matter. Furthermore, we use simulated gravitational-wave data to study the ability to search for eccentric gravitational-wave signals using a quasi-circular waveform template bank with Advanced LIGO design sensitivity. For a match-filtering targeted search, assuming binaries with a delta function mass ofand the eccentricity distribution derived from this late-universe formation channel,of the signals would be missed compared to the ideal detection rate due to the mismatch in the gravitational-wave signal from eccentricity.

[2101.12270] 1 Introduction			r.ullah@qub.ac.uk	In recent years, there has been a massive increase in the amount of Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as the data generated by such devices. The participating devices in IoT networks can be problematic due to their resource-constrained nature, and integrating security on these devices is often overlooked. This has resulted in attackers having an increased incentive to target IoT devices. As the number of attacks possible on a network increases, it becomes more difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to cope with these attacks efficiently. In this paper, we highlight several machine learning (ML) methods such as k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and logistic regression (LR) that can be used in IDS. In this work, ML algorithms are compared for both binary and multi-class classification on Bot-IoT dataset. Based on several parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss, we experimentally compared the aforementioned ML algorithms. In the case of HTTP distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the accuracy of RF is 99%. Furthermore, other simulation results-based precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss metric reveal that RF outperforms on all types of attacks in binary classification. However, in multi-class classification, KNN outperforms other ML algorithms with an accuracy of 99%, which is 4% higher than RF.

Woese Institute for Genomic Biology University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Urbana IL 61801 USA		It is well recognized that population heterogeneity plays an important role in the spread of epidemics. While individual variations in social activity are often assumed to be persistent, i.e. constant in time, here we discuss the consequences of dynamic heterogeneity. By integrating the stochastic dynamics of social activity into traditional epidemiological models we demonstrate the emergence of a new long timescale governing the epidemic in broad agreement with empirical data. Our model captures multiple features of real-life epidemics such as COVID-19, including prolonged plateaus and multiple waves, which are transiently suppressed due to the dynamic nature of social activity. The existence of the long timescale due to the interplay between epidemic and social dynamics provides a unifying picture of how a fast-paced epidemic typically will transition to the endemic state.

However, it is nontrivial to adapt WaveNet to handle high-dimensional and physically constrained motion data. To this end, we add an encoder and a decoder to the WaveNet to translate the motion data into features and back to the predicted motions. We also add 1D convolution layers to take skeleton configuration as an input to model skeleton variations across different subjects. As a result, our network can scale up well to large-scale motion data sets across multiple subjects and support various applications, such as random and controllable motion synthesis, motion denoising, and motion completion, in a unified way. Complex motions, such as punching, kicking and, kicking while punching, are also well handled. Moreover, our network can synthesize motions for novel skeletons not in the training dataset. After fine-tuning the network with a few motion data of the novel skeleton, it is able to capture the personalized style implied in the motion and generate high-quality motions for the skeleton. Thus, it has the potential to be used as a pre-trained network in few-shot learning for motion modeling and synthesis. Experimental results show that our model can effectively handle the variation of skeleton configurations, and it runs fast to synthesize different types of motions on-line. We also perform user studies to verify that the quality of motions generated by our network is superior to the motions of state-of-the-art human motion synthesis methods.

The second implements a constant time lag model for tides without evolving spins. We demonstrate various uses of these features using stellar evolution data fromMESA(Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) as an example. The results of our tests agree with several studies in the literature on post-main sequence orbital evolution, and our convergence and performance studies respectively demonstrate our implementations’ accuracy and efficiency.

[2101.12279] GF-Flush: A GF(2) Algebraic Attack on Secure Scan Chains	Dake Chen, Chunxiao Lin, Peter A. Beerel			Scan chains provide increased controllability and observability for testing digital circuits. The increased testability, however, can also be a source of information leakage for sensitive designs. The state-of-the-art defenses to secure scan chains apply dynamic keys to pseudo-randomly invert the scan vectors. In this paper, we pinpoint an algebraic vulnerability of these dynamic defenses that involves creating and solving a system of linear equations over the finite field GF(2). In particular, we propose a novel GF(2)-based flush attack that breaks even the most rigorous version of state-of-the-art dynamic defenses. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack recovers the key as long as 500 bits in less than 7 seconds, the attack times are about one hundredth of state-of-the-art SAT based attacks on the same defenses. We then demonstrate how our attacks can be extended to scan chains compressed with Multiple-Input Signature Registers (MISRs).

[2101.12280] On the Degeneracy of Spin Ice Graphs, and Its Estimate via the Bethe Permanent	Francesco Caravelli Michael Saccone Cristiano Nisoli	Theoretical Division (T4) Los Alamos National Laboratory Los Alamos New Mexico 87545 USA		The concept of spin ice can be extended to a general graph. We study the degeneracy of spin ice graph on arbitrary interaction structures via graph theory. Via the mapping of spin ices to the Ising model, we clarify whether the inverse mapping is possible via a modified Krausz construction. From the gauge freedom of frustrated Ising systems, we derive exact, general results about frustration and degeneracy. We demonstrate for the first time that every spin ice graph, with the exception of the 1D Ising model, is degenerate. We then study how degeneracy scales in size, using the mapping between Eulerian trails and spin ice manifolds, and a permanental identity for the number of Eulerian orientations. We show that the Bethe permanent technique provides both an estimate and a lower bound to the frustration of spin ices on arbitrary graphs of even degree. While such technique can be used also to obtain an upper bound, we find that in all the examples we studied but one, another upper bound based on Schrijver inequality is tighter.

We first show that a leave-one-out, sieve NPIV estimator of the quadratic functional can attain a convergence rate that coincides with the lower bound previously derived inChen and Christensen [2018]. The minimax rate is achieved by the optimal choice of the sieve dimension (a key tuning parameter) that depends on the smoothness of the NPIV function and the degree of ill-posedness, both are unknown in practice. We next propose a Lepski-type data-driven choice of the key sieve dimension adaptive to the unknown NPIV model features. The adaptive estimator of the quadratic functional is shown to attain the minimax optimal rate in the severely ill-posed case and in the regular mildly ill-posed case, but up to a multiplicativefactor in the irregular mildly ill-posed case.

WilliamsonRandall Division for Cell and Molecular BiophysicsKing’s College LondonLondonUK&Ute HahnDepartment of MathematicsAarhus UniversityAarhus CDenmark	footnotetext:	Louis.Gammelgaard@gmail.com	Photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) is a powerful imaging technique for characterization of protein organization in biological cells. Due to the stochastic blinking of fluorescent probes, and camera discretization effects, each protein gives rise to a cluster of artificial observations. These blinking artifacts are an obstacle for quantitative analysis of PALM data, and tools for their correction are in high demand. We develop the Independent Blinking Cluster point process (IBCpp) family of models, which is suited for modeling of data from single-molecule localization microscopy modalities, and we present results on the mark correlation function. We then construct the PALM-IBCpp - a semiparametric IBCpp tailored for PALM data, and we describe a procedure for estimation of parameters, which can be used without parametric assumptions on the spatial organization of proteins. Our model is validated on nuclear pore complex reference data, where the ground truth was accurately recovered, and we demonstrate how the estimated blinking parameters can be used to perform a blinking corrected test for protein clustering in a cell expressing the adaptor protein LAT. Finally, we consider simulations with varying degrees of blinking and protein clustering to shed light on the expected performance in a range of realistic settings.

We show that a frequency window exists between two nearest neighbor vibrational poles in the dynamic polarizability where the trapping potential is “near magic” for multiple rotational states simultaneously. We show that the addition of a modest DC electric field ofleads to an exact magic-wavelength trap for the lowest three rotational states at a angular-frequency detuning ofGHz from the Xbtransition. We derive a set of analytical criteria that must be fulfilled to ensure the existence of such magic frequency windows and present an analytic expression for the position of the frequency window in terms of a set of experimentally measurable parameters. These results should inform future experiments requiring long coherence times on multiple rotational transitions in ultracold polar molecules.	
[2101.12292] Universal field dependence of magnetic resonance near zero frequency	H. Y. Yuan Rembert A. Duine	Institute for Theoretical Physics Utrecht University 3584 CC Utrecht The Netherlands		Magnetic resonance is a widely-established phenomenon that probes magnetic properties such as magnetic damping and anisotropy. Even though the typical resonance frequency of a magnet ranges from gigahertz to terahertz, experiments also report the resonance near zero frequency in a large class of magnets. Here we revisit this phenomenon by analyzing the symmetry of the system and find that the resonance frequency () follows a universal power law, whereis the critical field at which the resonance frequency is zero. When the magnet preserves the rotational symmetry around the external field (),. Otherwise,. The magnon excitations are gapped above, gapless atand gapped again below. The zero frequency is often accompanied by a reorientation transition in the magnetization. For the case that, this transition is described by a Landau theory for second-order phase transitions. We further show that the spin current driven by thermal gradient and spin-orbit effects can be significantly enhanced when the resonance frequency is close to zero, which can be measured electrically by converting the spin current into electric signals. This may provide an experimentally accessible way to characterize the critical field. Our findings provide a unified understanding of the magnetization dynamics near the critical field, and may, furthermore, inspire the study of magnon transport near magnetic transitions.

Jones matrices are used to determine the retardance and diattenuation introduced by an optical element or a sequence of elements. Moreover, they are the tool of choice to study optical geometric phases. However, the current sampling method for characterizing the Jones matrix of an optical element is inefficient, since the search space of the problem is in the realm of the real numbers and so applying a general sampling method is time-consuming. In this study, we present an initial approach for solving the problem of finding the eigenvectors that characterize the Jones matrix of a homogeneous optical element through Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). We evaluate the analytical performance of an EA with a Polynomial Mutation operator and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a Simulated Binary crossover operator and a Polynomial Mutation operator, and compare the results with those obtained through a general sampling method. The results show that both the EA and the GA out-performed a general sampling method of 6,000 measurements, by requiring in average 103 and 188 fitness functions measurements respectively, while having a perfect rate of convergence.

From our survey, we find that there are still opportunities at exploiting adapter-based injections and that it may be possible to further combine various of the explored approaches into one system.

There is strong evidence that the high stresses, strains, and strain rates developed as bubbles grow and collapse contribute to this tissue homogenization. While such stresses and strains have been examined computationally in model systems with assumed constitutive models (e.g., finite-deformation Neo-Hookean model) and viscoelastic properties determined under quasi-static conditions, recent studies proposed that the Quadratic Law Kelvin-Voigt (QLKV) constitutive model, which additionally accounts for strain stiffening, more accurately represents the viscoelastic response of soft materials subjected to cavitation; this model has also been used to infer viscoelastic properties at high rates. In this work, we use the QLKV model and these properties to calculate the time-dependent stress, strain, and strain rate fields produced during the growth and collapse of individual bubbles subjected to a histotripsy-relevant pressure waveform in agarose gels of 0.3 % and 1.0 % concentration and corresponding to actual (past) experiments. We find that, as the gel concentration is increased, strain stiffening manifests in larger elastic stresses and compressive stresses extending into the collapse phase, particularly for the 1.0 % concentration gel. As a result, the duration of the collapse phase also increases. In comparison with the conventional Neo-Hookean model, the compressive stress has a larger magnitude, extends farther into the surrounding medium, and shows an increased departure from growth/collapse symmetry close to the bubble; all of these effects are magnified in the stiffer gel.	histotripsy | cavitation | bubble dynamics | ultrasound bioeffects.

The optical lines can pump the hyperfine transitions, potentially forming masers. These spin-flip transitions of Rb and Cs are the principal transitions used in atomic clocks (theCs hyperfine transition defines the second). If they are detected in stellar atmospheres, these transitions would provide exceptionally precise clocks that can be used as accelerometers, as exoplanet detectors, as probes of the predictions of general relativity, as probes of light propagation effects, and as a means to do fundamental physics with telescopes. Observations of 21 M- and L-dwarfs, however, show no evidence for Rb or Cs maser action, and a previous survey of giant stars made no Rb maser detections.	
[2101.12299] Putting gradual types to work	Bhargav Shivkumar Enrique Naudon Lukasz Ziarek	institutetext:		In this paper, we describe our experience incorporating gradual types in a statically typed functional language with Hindley-Milner style type inference. Where most gradually typed systems aim to improve static checking in a dynamically typed language, we approach it from the opposite perspective and promote dynamic checking in a statically typed language. Our approach provides a glimpse into how languages like SML and OCaml might handle gradual typing. We discuss our implementation and challenges faced—specifically how gradual typing rules apply to our representation of composite and recursive types. We review the various implementations that add dynamic typing to a statically typed language in order to highlight the different ways of mixing static and dynamic typing and examine possible inspirations while maintaining the gradual nature of our type system. This paper also discusses our motivation for adding gradual types to our language, and the practical benefits of doing so in our industrial setting.

H. Bucksbaum	Department of Applied Physics Stanford University Stanford CA 94305Stanford PULSE Institute SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory2575 Sand Hill Road Menlo Park CA 94025		Polyatomic molecules in strong laser fields can undergo substantial nuclear motion within tens of femtoseconds. Ion imaging methods based on dissociation or Coulomb explosion therefore have difficulty faithfully recording the geometry dependence of the field ionization that initiates the dissociation process. Here we compare the strong-field double ionization and subsequent dissociation of water (both HO and DO) in 10-fs and 40-fs 800-nm laser pulses. We find that 10-fs pulses turn off before substantial internuclear motion occurs, whereas rapid internuclear motion can take place during the double ionization process for 40-fs pulses. The short-pulse measurements are consistent with a simple tunnel ionization picture, whose predictions help interpret the motion observed in the long-pulse measurements.

Our results generalize several existing results about diagonally quadratic BSDEs in the non-Markovian setting. As part of our analysis, we obtain new results about linear BSDEs with unbounded coefficients, which may be of independent interest. Through a non-uniqueness example, we answer a “crucial open question” raised by Harter and Richou by showing that the stochastic exponential of anmatrix-valuedBMOmartingale need not satisfy a reverse Hölder inequality.

[2101.12307] Magnetoresistive Sensor Detectivity: A Comparative Analysis	J. E. Davies J. D. Watts J. Novotny D. Huang P. G. Eames		jdavies@nve.com	We report on the noise performance characteristics of magnetic sensors using both magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) and giant magnetoresistance (GMR) elements. Each sensor studied has a notably different noise and detectivity. Of the sensors we measured, those based on GMR multilayers have the lowest noise and detectivity. However, the GMR sensor also has a significantly smaller linear range. To make a direct comparison between sensors we scale the linear operating ranges of each sensor to be the same. This is the phenomenological equivalent of modifying the flux concentration. Upon scaling the low frequency detectivity of the TMR sensors becomes essentially equal to that of the GMR sensor. Using the scaling approach we are able to place the detectivity in the context of other key parameters, namely size and power consumption. Lastly, we use this technique to examine the upper limit for magnetoresistive sensor performance based on a notional MTJ sensor using present record setting TMR values.

Zelaya		i.marquette@uq.edu.au veronique.hussin@umontreal.ca zelayame@crm.umontreal.ca	We extend and generalize the construction of Sturm-Liouville problems for a family of Hamiltonians constrained to fulfill a third-order shape-invariance condition and focusing on the “” hierarchy of solutions to the fourth Painlevé transcendent. Such a construction has been previously addressed in the literature for some particular cases but we realize it here in the most general case. The corresponding potential in the Hamiltonian operator is a rationally extended oscillator defined in terms of the conventional Okamoto polynomials, from which we identify three different zero-modes constructed in terms of the generalized Okamoto polynomials. The third-order ladder operators of the system reveal that the complete set of eigenfunctions is decomposed as a union of three disjoint sequences of solutions, generated from a set of three-term recurrence relations. We also identify a link between the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian operator and a special family of exceptional Hermite polynomial.

[2101.12316] Byzantine Fault-Tolerance in Peer-to-Peer Distributed Gradient-Descent	Nirupam Gupta Nitin H. Vaidya			We consider the problem of Byzantine fault-tolerance in the peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed gradient-descent method – a prominent algorithm for distributed optimization in a P2P system. In this problem, the system comprises of multiple agents, and each agent has a local cost function. In the fault-free case, when all the agents are honest, the P2P distributed gradient-descent method allows all the agents to reach a consensus on a solution that minimizes their aggregate cost. However, we consider a scenario where a certain number of agents may be Byzantine faulty. Such faulty agents may not follow an algorithm correctly, and may share arbitrary incorrect information to prevent other non-faulty agents from solving the optimization problem.

Zaslavsky333Schlumberger-Doll Research Center, 1 Hampshire St., Cambridge, MA 02139-1578		moskow@math.drexel.edu mzaslavsky@slb.com vdruskin1@gmail.com	Data-driven reduced order models (ROMs) are combined with the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation to produce a direct nonlinear inversion method. The ROM is viewed as a Galerkin projection and is sparse due to Lanczos orthogonalization. Embedding into the continuous problem, a data-driven internal solution is produced. This internal solution is then used in the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, thus making further iterative updates unnecessary. We show numerical experiments for spectral domain domain data for which our inversion is far superior to the Born inversion and works as well as when the true internal solution is known.	
[2101.12318] Experimentation for homogeneous policy change	Molly Offer-Westort &Drew Dimmery			When the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is violated and there is interference among units, there is not a uniquely defined Average Treatment Effect (ATE), and alternative estimands may be of interest, among them average unit-level differences in outcomes under different homogeneous treatment policies. We term this target the Homogeneous Assignment Average Treatment Effect (HAATE). We consider approaches to experimental design with multiple treatment conditions under partial interference and, given the estimand of interest, we show that difference-in-means estimators may perform better than correctly specified regression models in finite samples on root mean squared error (RMSE). With errors correlated at the cluster level, we demonstrate that two-stage randomization procedures with intra-cluster correlation of treatment strictly between zero and one may dominate one-stage randomization designs on the same metric. Simulations demonstrate performance of this approach; an application to online experiments at Facebook is discussed.	
[2101.12319] General conditions for universality of Quantum Hamiltonians	Tamara Kohler Stephen Piddock Johannes Bausch Toby Cubitt	Department of Computer Science University College London UK		Recent work has demonstrated the existence ofuniversalHamiltonians – simple spin lattice models that can simulate any other quantum many body system to any desired level of accuracy. Until now proofs of universality have relied on explicit constructions, tailored to each specific family of universal Hamiltonians. In this work we go beyond this approach, and completely classify the simulation ability of quantum Hamiltonians by their complexity classes. We do this by deriving necessary and sufficient complexity theoretic conditions characterising universal quantum Hamiltonians. Although the result concerns the theory of analogue Hamiltonian simulation – a promising application of near-term quantum technology – the proof relies on abstract complexity theoretic concepts and the theory of quantum computation. As well as providing simplified proofs of previous Hamiltonian universality results, and offering a route to new universal constructions, the results in this paper give insight into the origins of universality. For example, finally explaining the previously noted coincidences between families of universal Hamiltonian and classes of Hamiltonians appearing in complexity theory.

To address this limitation, an experimental system is designed by tuning a one-dimensional magnetic lattice to evolve benign wave forms into shock waves at observable spatial and temporal scales, thus serving as a ‘magnifying glass’ to illuminate shock processes. An accompanying analysis confirms that the formation of strong shocks is fully captured. The exhibited lack of a steady state induced by indefinite expansion of a disordered transition zone points to the absence of local thermodynamic equilibrium, and resurfaces lingering questions on the validity of continuum assumptions in presence of strong shocks.	
[2101.12321] Topological transitions during grain growth on a finite element mesh	Erdem Eren Jeremy K. Mason	of Materials Science and Engineering University of California at Davis Davis CA 95616 USA	jkylemason@ucdavis.edu ereren@ucdavis.edu	The topological transitions that occur to the grain boundary network during grain growth in a material with uniform grain boundary energies are believed to be known. The same is not true for more realistic materials, since more general grain boundary energies in principle allow many more viable grain boundary configurations. A simulation of grain growth in such a material therefore requires a procedure to enumerate all possible topological transitions and select the most energetically favorable one. Such a procedure is developed and implemented here for a microstructure represented by a volumetric finite element mesh. As a specific example, all possible transitions for a typical configuration with five grains around a junction point are enumerated, and some exceptional transitions are found to be energetically similar to the conventional ones even for a uniform boundary energy. A general discrete formulation to calculate grain boundary velocities is used to simulate grain growth for an example microstructure. The method is implemented as a C++ library based on SCOREC, an open source massively parallelizable library for finite element simulations with adaptive meshing.

An implication of this is that a filter may know what it is looking at, but not where it is positioned in the image. In this paper, we first test this hypothesis and reveal that a surprising degree of absolute position information is encoded in commonly used CNNs. We show that zero padding drives CNNs to encode position information in their internal representations, while a lack of padding precludes position encoding. This gives rise to deeper questions about the role of position information in CNNs: (i) What boundary heuristics enable optimal position encoding for downstream tasks?; (ii) Does position encoding affect the learning of semantic representations?; (iii) Does position encoding always improve performance? To provide answers, we perform the largest case study to date on the role that padding and border heuristics play in CNNs. We design novel tasks which allow us to quantify boundary effects as a function of the distance to the border. Numerous semantic objectives reveal the effect of the border on semantic representations. Finally, we demonstrate the implications of these findings on multiple real-world tasks to show that position information can both help or hurt performance.

The path length variable is in duality with a shift of the weights. This puts into a convex duality framework old observations about the convergence of the normalized Euclidean length of geodesics due to Hammersley and Welsh, Smythe and Wierman, and Kesten, and leads to new results about geodesic length and the regularity of the shape function as a function of the weight shift. For points far enough away from the origin, the ratio of the geodesic length and thedistance to the endpoint is uniformly bounded away from one. The shape function is a strictly concave function of the weight shift. Atoms of the weight distribution generate singularities, that is, points of nondifferentiability, in this function. We generalize to all distributions, directions and dimensions an old singularity result of Steele and Zhang for the planar Bernoulli case. When the weight distribution has two or more atoms, a dense set of shifts produce singularities. The results come from a combination of the convex duality, the shape theorems of the different first-passage optimization problems, and modification arguments.

Hollenberg	School of Physics University of Melbourne VIC 3010 AustraliaCentre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology School of Physics University of Melbourne VIC 3010 Australia	lloydch@unimelb.edu.au jtetienne@unimelb.edu.au	The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond has emerged as a candidate to non-invasively hyperpolarise nuclear spins in molecular systems to improve the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Several promising proof of principle experiments have demonstrated small-scale polarisation transfer from single NVs to hydrogen spins outside the diamond. However, the scaling up of these results to the use of a dense NV ensemble, which is a necessary prerequisite for achieving realistic NMR sensitivity enhancement, has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we present evidence for a polarising interaction between a shallow NV ensemble and external nuclear targets over a micrometre scale, and characterise the challenges in achieving useful polarisation enhancement. In the most favourable example of the interaction with hydrogen in a solid state target, a maximum polarisation transfer rate ofspins per second per NV is measured, averaged over an area containing orderNVs. Reduced levels of polarisation efficiency are found for liquid state targets, where molecular diffusion limits the transfer. Through analysis via a theoretical model, we find that our results suggest implementation of this technique for NMR sensitivity enhancement is feasible following realistic diamond material improvements.	
[2101.12326] The Optimal Dynamic Treatment Rule SuperLearner: Considerations, Performance, and Application	Lina Montoya Mark van der Laan Alexander Luedtke Jennifer Skeem Jeremy Coyle Maya Petersen	Email address for correspondence: of North Carolina Chapel Hill Department of Biostatistics	lmontoya@unc.edu	The optimal dynamic treatment rule (ODTR) framework offers an approach for understanding which kinds of patients respond best to specific treatments – in other words, treatment effect heterogeneity. Recently, there has been a proliferation of methods for estimating the ODTR. One such method is an extension of the SuperLearner algorithm – an ensemble method to optimally combine candidate algorithms extensively used in prediction problems – to ODTRs. Following the “causal roadmap,” we causally and statistically define the ODTR and provide an introduction to estimating it using the ODTR SuperLearner. Additionally, we highlight practical choices when implementing the algorithm, including choice of candidate algorithms, metalearners to combine the candidates, and risk functions to select the best combination of algorithms. Using simulations, we illustrate how estimating the ODTR using this SuperLearner approach can uncover treatment effect heterogeneity more effectively than traditional approaches based on fitting a parametric regression of the outcome on the treatment, covariates and treatment-covariate interactions. We investigate the implications of choices in implementing an ODTR SuperLearner at various sample sizes. Our results show the advantages of: (1) including a combination of both flexible machine learning algorithms and simple parametric estimators in the library of candidate algorithms; (2) using an ensemble metalearner to combine candidates rather than selecting only the best-performing candidate; (3) using the mean outcome under the rule as a risk function. Finally, we apply the ODTR SuperLearner to the “Interventions” study, an ongoing randomized controlled trial, to identify which justice-involved adults with mental illness benefit most from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to reduce criminal re-offending.

The contribution of each member in the coalition can be transferable to its individual profit. While maximizing the number of received contents in the fixed time, the cooperative scheme also ensures the individual profit of each OBU in the coalition. We evaluate the proposed scheme by extensive simulations in mmWave vehicular networks. Compared with other existing schemes, the proposed scheme has superior performances on the number of possessed contents and system fairness. Besides, the low complexity of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by the switch operation number and CPU time.	millimeter wave | vehicular network | vehicle-to-vehicle | cooperative scheme | coalition formation game.
[2101.12329] Dynamically reversible and strong circular dichroism based on Babinet-invertible chiral metasurfaces	Xiaoqing Luo, Fangrong Hu, and Guangyuan Li		gy.li@siat.ac.cn	We propose a Babinet-invertible chiral metasurface for achieving dynamically reversible and strong circular dichroism (CD). The proposed metasurface is composed of VO-metal hybrid structure, and when VOtransits between the dielectric state and the metallic state, the metasurface unit cell switches between complementary structures that are designed according to the Babinet principle. This leads to a large and reversible CD tuning range betweenat 0.97 THz, which is larger than the literature. We attribute the CD effect to extrinsic chirality of the proposed metasurface. We envision that the Babinet-invertible chiral metasurface proposed here will advance the engineering of active and tunable chiro-optical devices and promote their applications.	
[2101.12330] Multi-Dimensional Parameter Study of Double Detonation Type Ia Supernovae Originating from Thin-Helium-Shell White Dwarfs	Samuel J. Boos Dean M. Townsley Ken J. Shen Spencer Caldwell Broxton J. Miles	Department of Physics & Astronomy University of Alabama Tuscaloosa AL USA		Despite the importance of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) throughout astronomy, the precise progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms that drive SNe Ia are still unknown. An explosion scenario that has gained traction recently is the double detonation in which an accreted shell of He detonates and triggers a secondary detonation in the underlying white dwarf. Our research presents a number of high resolution, multi-dimensional, full star simulations of thin-He-shell, sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf progenitors that undergo a double detonation. This suite of thin-shell progenitors incorporates He shells that are thinner than those in previous multi-dimensional studies. We confirm the viability of the double detonation across a range of He shell parameter space as well as present bulk yields and ejecta profiles for each progenitor. The yields obtained are generally consistent with previous works and indicate the likelihood of producing observables that resemble SNe Ia. The dimensionality of our simulations allow us to examine features of the double detonation more closely, including the details of the off-center secondary ignition and asymmetric ejecta. We find considerable differences in the high-velocity extent of post-detonation products across different lines of sight. The data from this work will be used to generate predicted observables and may further support the viability of the double detonation scenario as a SNe Ia channel as well as show how properties of the progenitor or viewing angle may influence trends in observable characteristics.	nuclear reactions | nucleosynthesis | abundances — supernovae: general

[2101.12332] Atomic Swaps between Bitcoin and Monero	Philipp Hoenisch Lucas Soriano del Pino	institutetext:		Due to the evergrowing blockchain ecosystem, interoperability has become a matter of great importance. Atomic swaps allow connecting otherwise isolated blockchains while adhering to the core principles of censorship resistance and permissionlessnes. Up until recently, atomic swap protocols have mostly relied on complex script support, excluding certain types of blockchains. With advances in cryptography, it is now possible to build a bridge between almost any two blockchains. In this work, we give an explanation of one such protocol which applies adaptor signatures on Bitcoin to procure atomic swaps between Monero and Bitcoin. We dive into the cryptographic details, discuss its limitations and give an outlook on our current work where we use adaptor signatures on the Monero signature scheme.

Tamer Özsu	University of	aida.sheshbolouki@uwaterloo.ca tamer.ozsu@uwaterloo.ca	We study the fundamental problem of butterfly (i.e. (2,2)-bicliques) counting in bipartite streaming graphs. Similar to triangles in unipartite graphs, enumerating butterflies is crucial in understanding the structure of bipartite graphs. This benefits many applications where studying the cohesion in a graph shaped data is of particular interest. Examples include investigating the structure of computational graphs or input graphs to the algorithms, as well as dynamic phenomena and analytic tasks over complex real graphs. Butterfly counting is computationally expensive, and known techniques do not scale to large graphs; the problem is even harder in streaming graphs. In this paper, following a data-driven methodology, we first conduct an empirical analysis to uncover temporal organizing principles of butterflies in real streaming graphs and then we introduce an approximate adaptive window-based algorithm, sGrapp, for counting butterflies as well as its optimized version sGrapp-x. sGrapp is designed to operate efficiently and effectively over any graph stream with any temporal behavior. Experimental studies of sGrapp and sGrapp-x show superior performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

Representative skills that exhibit such ability include generating image descriptions and visually grounded referring expressions. In the NLG community, these generation tasks are largely investigated in non-interactive and language-only settings. However, in face-to-face interaction, humans often deploy multiple modalities to communicate, forming seamless integration of natural language, hand gestures and other modalities like sketches. To enable robots to describe what they perceive with speech and sketches/gestures, we propose to model the task of generating natural language together with free-hand sketches/hand gestures to describe visual scenes and reallife objects, namely, visually-grounded multimodal description generation. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and evaluation metrics of the task, and how the task can benefit from progress recently made in the natural language processing and computer vision realms, where related topics such as visually grounded NLG, distributional semantics, and photo-based sketch generation have been extensively studied.

The median redshift and mass of our detected clusters are about 0.53 and, respectively. Comparing with previous clusters identified using the data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we can recognize most of them, especially those with high richness.

In order to understand such surface alloying of immiscible metals, we study the energetic stability of binary alloys,and, in several structures with various coordination numbers (CNs). By analyzing the formation energy modified to enhance the subtle energy difference between metastable structures, we find thatandwith B2-type structure (CN8) become energetically stable when theandmetals form an alloy on themetal surface. This is consistent with the experimental results for Pb-Sn alloys on metal surfaces such as Rh(111) and Ru(0001). Some suitable metal substrates are also predicted to form Pb-Sn alloys.

In the active systems a yielding transition toward a liquid phase is observed when the self-propulsion is increased. The range of self-propulsions in which this pure liquid regime exists appears to vanish upon approaching the so-called ‘jamming point’ at which solidity of soft-sphere packings is lost. Such an ‘active yielding’ transition shares similarities with the generic yielding transition for shear flows. A Herschel-Bulkley law is observed along the liquid regime in both loading scenarios, with a clear difference in the critical scaling exponents between the two, suggesting the existent of different universality classes for the yielding transition under different driving conditions. In addition, we present direct measurements of growing length and time scales for both driving scenarios. A comparison with theoretical predictions from recent literature reveals poor agreement with our numerical results.

However, existing deep hashing methods have a poor small-sample ranking performance for case-based medical image retrieval. The top-ranked images in the returned query results may be as a different class than the query image. This ranking problem is caused by classification, regions of interest (ROI), and small-sample information loss in the hashing space. To address the ranking problem, we propose an end-to-end framework, called Attention-based Triplet Hashing (ATH) network, to learn low-dimensional hash codes that preserve the classification, ROI, and small-sample information. We embed a spatial-attention module into the network structure of our ATH to focus on ROI information. The spatial-attention module aggregates the spatial information of feature maps by utilizing max-pooling, element-wise maximum, and element-wise mean operations jointly along the channel axis. To highlight the essential role of classification in diﬀerentiating case-based medical images, we propose a novel triplet cross-entropy loss to achieve maximal class-separability and maximal hash code-discriminability simultaneously during model training. The triplet cross-entropy loss can help to map the classification information of images and similarity between images into the hash codes. Moreover, by adopting triplet labels during model training, we can utilize the small-sample information fully to alleviate the imbalanced-sample problem. Extensive experiments on two case-based medical datasets demonstrate that our proposed ATH can further improve the retrieval performance compared to the state-of-the-art deep hashing methods and boost the ranking performance for small samples. Compared to the other loss methods, the triplet cross-entropy loss can enhance the classification performance and hash code-discriminability.

The large and growing volume of time series data from photometric surveys demands computationally efficient methods for detecting and characterizing such signals. The most efficient algorithms available for this purpose are those that exploit thescaling of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). However, these methods are not optimal for non-sinusoidal signal shapes. Template fits (or periodic matched filters) optimize sensitivity fora prioriknown signal shapes but at a significant computational cost. Current implementations of template periodograms scale as, whereis the number of trial frequencies andis the number of lightcurve observations, and due to non-convexity, they do not guarantee the best fit at each trial frequency, which can lead to spurious results. In this work, we present a non-linear extension of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to obtain a template-fitting algorithm that is both accurate (globally optimal solutions are obtained except in pathological cases) and computationally efficient (scaling asfor a given template). The non-linear optimization of the template fit at each frequency is recast as a polynomial zero-finding problem, where the coefficients of the polynomial can be computed efficiently with the non-equispaced fast Fourier transform. We show that our method, which uses truncated Fourier series to approximate templates, is an order of magnitude faster than existing algorithms for small problems (observations) and 2 orders of magnitude faster for long base-line time series withobservations. An open-source implementation of the fast template periodogram is available atgithub.com/PrincetonUniversity/FastTemplatePeriodogram.

Fuzzy bisimulations between fuzzy automata over a complete residuated lattice have been introduced by Ćirićet al. in 2012. Logical characterizations of fuzzy bisimulations between fuzzy Kripke models (respectively, fuzzy interpretations in description logics) over the residuated latticewith the Gödel t-norm have been provided by Fan in 2015 (respectively, Nguyenet al. in 2020). There was the lack of logical characterizations of fuzzy bisimulations between fuzzy graph-based structures over a general residuated lattice, as well as over the residuated latticewith the Łukasiewicz or product t-norm. In this article, we provide and prove logical characterizations of fuzzy bisimulations in fuzzy modal logics over residuated lattices. The considered logics are the fuzzy propositional dynamic logic and its fragments. Our logical characterizations concern invariance of formulas under fuzzy bisimulations and the Hennessy-Milner property of fuzzy bisimulations. They can be reformulated for other fuzzy structures such as fuzzy labeled transition systems and fuzzy interpretations in description logics.	bisimulation | fuzzy bisimulation | fuzzy modal logic | residuated lattice

This paper makes the first attempt to study the NBTI aging in the on-chip weight memories of deep neural network (DNN) hardware accelerators, subjected to complex DNN workloads. We propose DNN-Life, a specialized aging analysis and mitigation framework for DNNs, which jointly exploits hardware- and software-level knowledge to improve the lifetime of a DNN weight memory with reduced energy overhead. At the software-level, we analyze the effects of different DNN quantization methods on the distribution of the bits of weight values. Based on the insights gained from this analysis, we propose a micro-architecture that employs low-cost memory-write (and read) transducers to achieve an optimal duty-cycle at run time in the weight memory cells, thereby balancing their aging. As a result, our DNN-Life framework enables efficient aging mitigation of weight memory of the given DNN hardware at minimal energy overhead during the inference process.

Ecuador 3493 Santiago Chile	gduring@uc.cl	Despite their outstanding mechanical properties, with many industrial applications, a rational and systematic design of new and controlled auxetic materials remains poorly developed. Here a unified framework is established to describe bidimensional perfect auxetics with potential use in the design of new materials. Perfect auxetics are characterized by a Poisson’s ratioover a finite strain range and can be modeled as materials composed of rotating rigid units. Inspired by a natural connection between these rotating rigid units with an antiferromagnetic spin system, here are unveiled the conditions for the emergence of a non-trivial floppy mode responsible for the auxetic behavior. Furthermore, this model paves a simple pathway for the design of new auxetic materials, based on three simple steps, which set the sufficient connectivity and geometrical constraints for perfect auxetics. In particular, a new exotic crystal, a Penrose quasi-crystal and the long desired isotropic auxetic material are designed and constructed for the first time. Using 3D printed materials, finite element methods and this rigid unit model, the auxetic behavior of these designs is shown to be robust under small disturbances in the structure, though the Poisson’s ratio value relies on system’s details, approachingclose to the ideal case.

We prove that neural networks can transform a low-dimensional source distribution to a distribution that is arbitrarily close to a high-dimensional target distribution, when the closeness are measured by Wasserstein distances and maximum mean discrepancy. Upper bounds of the approximation error are obtained in terms of the width and depth of neural network. Furthermore, it is shown that the approximation error in Wasserstein distance grows at most linearly on the ambient dimension and that the approximation order only depends on the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution. On the contrary, when-divergences are used as metrics of distributions, the approximation property is different. We show that in order to approximate the target distribution in-divergences, the dimension of the source distribution cannot be smaller than the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution.

The methodology of the approach is to modify the traditional Darcy’s law into the hybrid-dimensional Darcy’s law where fractures and barriers are represented as Dirac-functions contained in the permeability tensor and resistance tensor, respectively. As a natural extension of the reinterpreted discrete fracture model[21]for highly conductive fractures, this model is able to account for the influence of both highly conductive fractures and blocking barriers accurately on non-conforming meshes. The local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method is employed to accommodate the form of the hybrid-dimensional Darcy’s law and the nature of the pressure/flux discontinuity. The performance of the model is demonstrated by several numerical tests.

Our test integrates the U-statistic based approach in a recent work byWang et al. (2019)and the-norm based high-dimensional test inHe et al. (2020), and inherits several appealing features such as being tuning parameter free and asymptotic independence for test statistics corresponding to evens. A simple combination of test statistics corresponding to several differents leads to a test with adaptive power property, that is, it can be powerful against both sparse and dense alternatives. On the estimation front, we obtain the convergence rate of the maximizer of our test statistic standardized by sample size when there is one change-point in mean and, and propose to combine our tests with a wild binary segmentation (WBS) algorithm to estimate the change-point number and locations when there are multiple change-points. Numerical comparisons using both simulated and real data demonstrate the advantage of our adaptive test and its corresponding estimation method.	Keywords
[2101.12358] The hybrid dimensional representation of permeability tensor: a reinterpretation of the discrete fracture model and its extension on nonconforming meshes1footnote 11footnote 1Supported by the NSF grant DMS-1818467	Ziyao Xu222Department of Mathematical Sciences, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI 49931. E-mail:  Yang Yang333Department of Mathematical Sciences, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI 49931. E-mail:		ziyaox@mtu.edu yyang7@mtu.edu	The discrete fracture model (DFM) has been widely used in the simulation of fluid flow in fractured porous media. Traditional DFM uses the so-called hybrid-dimensional approach to treat fractures explicitly as low-dimensional entries (e.g. line entries in 2D media and face entries in 3D media) on the interfaces of matrix cells and then couple the matrix and fracture flow systems together based on the principle of superposition with the fracture thickness used as the dimensional homogeneity factor. Because of this methodology, DFM is considered to be limited on conforming meshes and thus may raise difficulties in generating high quality unstructured meshes due to the complexity of fracture’s geometrical morphology. In this paper, we clarify that the DFM actually can be extended to non-conforming meshes without any essential changes. To show it clearly, we provide another perspective for DFM based on hybrid-dimensional representation of permeability tensor to describe fractures as one-dimensional line Dirac delta functions contained in permeability tensor. A finite element DFM scheme for single-phase flow on non-conforming meshes is then derived by applying Galerkin finite element method to it. Analytical analysis and numerical experiments show that our DFM automatically degenerates to the classical finite element DFM when the mesh is conforming with fractures. Moreover, the accuracy and efficiency of the model on non-conforming meshes are demonstrated by testing several benchmark problems. This model is also applicable to curved fracture with variable thickness.Key Words:fractured porous media, discrete fracture model, non-conforming meshes, hybrid-dimensional representation, line Dirac delta function	Key Words:

Paddison Hasitha Suriya Arachchige Ganesh Pokharel Clarina dela Cruz Qiang Zhang Georg Ehlers David S. Parker David G. Mandrus Matthew B. Stone Andrew D. Christianson	thanks:		The hierarchy of the coupling strengths in a physical system often engenders an effective model at low energies where the decoupled high-energy modes are integrated out. Here, using neutron scattering, we show that the spin excitations in the breathing pyrochlore lattice compound CuInCrSare hierarchical and can be approximated by an effective model of correlated tetrahedra at low energies. At higher energies, intra-tetrahedron excitations together with strong magnon-phonon couplings are observed, which suggests the possible role of the lattice degree of freedom in stabilizing the spin tetrahedra. Our work illustrates the spin dynamics in CuInCrSand demonstrates a general effective-cluster approach to understand the dynamics on the breathing-type lattices.

We describe a novel protocol where one can effectively generate large optical nonlinearities via the conditional application of a linear operation on an optical mode by an ancilla mode, followed by a measurement of the ancilla and corrective operation on the probe mode. Our protocol can generate high quality optical Schrödinger cat states useful for optical quantum computing and can be used to perform sensing of an unknown rotation or displacement in phase space, with super-Heisenberg scaling in the resources. We finally describe a potential experimental implementation using atomic ensembles interacting with optical modes via the Faraday effect.	
[2101.12365] Sharp Bounds on the Approximation Rates, Metric Entropy, and 𝑛-widths of Shallow Neural Networks	Jonathan W. SiegelDepartment of MathematicsPennsylvania State UniversityUniversity Park, PA  XuDepartment of MathematicsPennsylvania State UniversityUniversity Park, PA		jxx1@psu.edu jus1949@psu.edu	In this article, we study approximation properties of the variation spaces corresponding to shallow neural networks with a variety of activation functions. We introduce two main tools for estimating the metric entropy, approximation rates, and-widths of these spaces. First, we introduce the notion of a smoothly parameterized dictionary and give upper bounds on the non-linear approximation rates, metric entropy and-widths of their absolute convex hull. The upper bounds depend upon the order of smoothness of the parameterization. This result is applied to dictionaries of ridge functions corresponding to shallow neural networks, and they improve upon existing results in many cases. Next, we provide a method for lower bounding the metric entropy and-widths of variation spaces which contain certain classes of ridge functions. This result gives sharp lower bounds on the-approximation rates, metric entropy, and-widths for variation spaces corresponding to neural networks with a range of important activation functions, including ReLUactivation functions and sigmoidal activation functions with bounded variation.	
[2101.12366] Deep Generative SToRM model for dynamic imaging				We introduce a novel generative smoothness regularization on manifolds (SToRM) model for the recovery of dynamic image data from highly undersampled measurements. The proposed generative framework represents the image time series as a smooth non-linear function of low-dimensional latent vectors that capture the cardiac and respiratory phases. The non-linear function is represented using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Unlike the popular CNN approaches that require extensive fully-sampled training data that is not available in this setting, the parameters of the CNN generator as well as the latent vectors are jointly estimated from the undersampled measurements using stochastic gradient descent. We penalize the norm of the gradient of the generator to encourage the learning of a smooth surface/manifold, while temporal gradients of the latent vectors are penalized to encourage the time series to be smooth. The main benefits of the proposed scheme are (a) the quite significant reduction in memory demand compared to the analysis based SToRM model, and (b) the spatial regularization brought in by the CNN model. We also introduce efficient progressive approaches to minimize the computational complexity of the algorithm.

It is claimed that an event shape observable like transverse sphericity is able to discriminate between jet-like events and events that are dominated by soft production from the underlying event.

Moreover, the same domain growth law is observed in the proposed method and the Monte Carlo method.

We define a general model called theuniform sub-hypergraph stochastic block model (ShSBM). Under theShSBM, we use Fano’s inequality to identify the region of model parameters where any algorithm fails to exactly recover the planted communities with a large probability. We also identify the region where a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm succeeds to exactly recover the communities with high probability. Our bounds are tight and pertain to the community detection problems in various models such as the planted hypergraph stochastic block model, the planted densest sub-hypergraph model, and the planted multipartite hypergraph model.

This paper proposes a framework combining cost-sensitive classification and adversarial learning together to train a model that can distinguish between protected and unprotected classes, such that the protected classes are less vulnerable to adversarial examples. We find in this framework an interesting phenomenon during the training of deep neural networks, called Min-Max property, that is, the absolute values of most parameters in the convolutional layer approach zero while the absolute values of a few parameters are significantly larger becoming bigger. Based on this Min-Max property which is formulated and analyzed in a view of random distribution, we further build a new defense model against adversarial examples for adversarial robustness improvement. An advantage of the built model is that it performs better than the standard one and can combine with adversarial training to achieve an improved performance. It is experimentally confirmed that, regarding the average accuracy of all classes, our model is almost as same as the existing models when an attack does not occur and is better than the existing models when an attack occurs. Specifically, regarding the accuracy of protected classes, the proposed model is much better than the existing models when an attack occurs.

[2101.12373] The Evolutionary Pathways of Disk-, Bulge-, and Halo-dominated Galaxies	Min Du Luis C. Ho Victor P. Debattista Annalisa Pillepich Dylan Nelson Lars Hernquist Rainer Weinberger	Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics Peking University Beijing 100871 China		To break the degeneracy among galactic stellar components, we extract kinematic structures using the framework described inDu et al. (2019,2020). For example, the concept of stellar halos is generalized to weakly-rotating structures that are composed of loosely bound stars, which can hence be associated to both disk and elliptical type morphologies. By applying this method to central galaxies with stellar massfrom the TNG50 simulation, we identify three broadly-defined types of galaxies: ones dominated by disk, by bulge, or by stellar halo structures. We then use the simulation to infer the underlying connection between the growth of structures and physical processes over cosmic time. Tracing galaxies back in time, we recognize three fundamental regimes: an early phase of evolution (), and internal and external (mainly mergers) processes that act at later times. We find that disk- and bulge-dominated galaxies are not significantly affected by mergers since; the difference in their present-day structures originates from two distinct evolutionary pathways, extended vs. compact, that are likely determined by their parent dark matter halos; i.e., nature. On the other hand, slow rotator elliptical galaxies are typically halo-dominated, forming by external processes (e.g. mergers) in the later phase, i.e., nurture. This picture challenges the general idea that elliptical galaxies are the same objects as classical bulges. In observations, both bulge- and halo-dominated galaxies are likely to be classified as early-type galaxies with compact morphology and quiescent star formation. However, here we find them to have very different evolutionary histories.

These paths are also hampered by significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, services provisioning, and network management. Blockchain, which is a technology for building distributed ledgers that provide an immutable log of transactions recorded in a distributed network, has become prominent recently as the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies and is revolutionizing data storage and processing in computer network systems. For future data-driven networks (DDNs), blockchain is considered as a promising solution to enable the secure storage, sharing, and analytics of data, privacy protection for users, robust, trustworthy network control, and decentralized routing and resource managements. However, many important challenges and open issues remain to be addressed before blockchain can be deployed widely to enable future DDNs. In this article, we present a survey on the existing research works on the application of blockchain technologies in computer networks, and identify challenges and potential solutions in the applications of blockchains in future DDNs. We identify application scenarios in which future blockchain-empowered DDNs could improve the efficiency and security, and generally the effectiveness of network services.

In this work, we show that standard deep learning approaches to 3D pose estimation are not robust when objects are partially occluded or viewed from a previously unseen pose. Inspired by the robustness of generative vision models to partial occlusion, we propose to integrate deep neural networks with 3D generative representations of objects into a unified neural architecture that we term NeMo. In particular, NeMo learns a generative model of neural feature activations at each vertex on a dense 3D mesh. Using differentiable rendering we estimate the 3D object pose by minimizing the reconstruction error between NeMo and the feature representation of the target image. To avoid local optima in the reconstruction loss, we train the feature extractor to maximize the distance between the individual feature representations on the mesh using contrastive learning. Our extensive experiments on PASCAL3D+, occluded-PASCAL3D+ and ObjectNet3D show that NeMo is much more robust to partial occlusion and unseen pose compared to standard deep networks, while retaining competitive performance on regular data. Interestingly, our experiments also show that NeMo performs reasonably well even when the mesh representation only crudely approximates the true object geometry with a cuboid, hence revealing that the detailed 3D geometry is not needed for accurate 3D pose estimation. The code is publicly available athttps://github.com/Angtian/NeMo.

In the last 20 years, several works have shown the importance of this quantity to obtain precise approximations for several recurrence time distributions in mixing stochastic processes and dynamical systems. Besides providing a review of the different scaling factors used in the literature in recurrence times, the present work contribute with two new results: (1) for-mixing and-mixing processes, we give a new exponential approximation for hitting and return times using the potential well as scaling parameter. The error terms are explicit and sharp. (2) We analyse the uniform positivity of the potential well.

First, we find the convergence of the RTP towardsin the Wassersteindistance, which in turn is a consequence of Donsker Theorem. Then, we use this result to derive the rate of convergence between their respective number of zeros. Since the number of real zeros of the RTP is not a continuous function, we use the Kac-Rice formula to express it as the limit of an integral and, in this way, we approximate it by locally Lipschitz continuous functions.

In this paper, we propose a novel PLS technique with the help of IRS implemented by an intelligent mirror array for the visible light communication (VLC) system. First, for the IRS aided VLC system containing an access point (AP), a legitimate user and an eavesdropper, the IRS channel gain and a lower bound of the achievable secrecy rate are derived. Further, to enhance the IRS channel gain of the legitimate user while restricting the IRS channel gain of the eavesdropper, we formulate an achievable secrecy rate maximization problem for the proposed IRS-aided PLS technique to find the optimal orientations of mirrors. Since the sensitivity of mirrors’ orientations on the IRS channel gain makes the optimization problem hard to solve, we transform the original problem into a reflected spot position optimization problem and solve it by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Our simulation results show that secrecy performance can be significantly improved by adding an IRS in a VLC system.

As the periodicity of a QFP wave could originate from a periodic source or be dispersively waveguided, it is a key parameter for diagnosing the flaring core and waveguide. In this paper, we study two QFP waves excited by aGOES-class C1.3 solar flare occurring at active region NOAA 12734 on 8 March 2019. Two QFP waves were guided by two oppositely oriented coronal funnel. The periods of two QFP waves were identical and were roughly equal to the period of the oscillatory signal in the X-ray and 17 GHz radio emission released by the flaring core. It is very likely that the two QFP waves could be periodically excited by the flaring core. Many features of this QFP wave event is consistent with the magnetic tuning fork model. We also investigated the seismological application with QFP waves, and found that the magnetic field inferred with magnetohydrodynamic seismology was consistent with that obtained in magnetic extrapolation model. Our study suggest that the QFP wave is a good tool for diagnosing both the flaring core and the magnetic waveguide.	Sun: corona — Sun: oscillations - waves — Sun: flares

Sacksteder IV	of Physics Royal Holloway University of London Egham Hill Egham TW20 0EX United KingdomDepartment of Physics and Astronomy Rutgers University NJ USA	vincent@sacksteder.com	Among the models of disordered conduction and localization, models withorbitals per site are attractive both for their mathematical tractability and for their physical realization in coupled disordered grains. However Wegner proved that there is no Anderson transition and no localized phase in thelimit, if the hopping constantis kept fixed.Wegner (1979); Khorunzhy and Pastur (1993)Here we show that the localized phase is preserved in a different limit whereis taken to infinity and the hoppingis simultaneously adjusted to keepconstant. We support this conclusion with two arguments. The first is numerical computations of the localization length showing that in thelimit the site-diagonal-disorder model possesses a localized phase ifis kept constant, but does not possess that phase ifis fixed. The second argument is a detailed analysis of the energy and length scales in a functional integral representation of the gauge invariant model. The analysis shows that in thefixed limit the functional integral’s spins do not exhibit long distance fluctuations, i.e. such fluctuations are massive and therefore decay exponentially, which signals conduction. In contrast thefixed limit preserves the massless character of certain spin fluctuations, allowing them to fluctuate over long distance scales and cause Anderson localization.

To understand the physical mechanisms governing their occurrences, three-dimensional magnetic fields from the photosphere up to the corona must be studied. The solar photospheric magnetic fields are observable, whereas the coronal magnetic fields cannot be measured. One method for inferring coronal magnetic fields is performing data-driven simulations, which involves time-series observational data of the photospheric magnetic fields with the bottom boundary of magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We developed a data-driven method in which temporal evolutions of the observational vector magnetic field can be reproduced at the bottom boundary in the simulation by introducing an inverted velocity field. This velocity field is obtained by inversely solving the induction equation and applying an appropriate gauge transformation. Using this method, we performed a data-driven simulation of successive small eruptions observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Magnetic Activity Telescope in November 2017. The simulation well reproduced the converging motion between opposite-polarity magnetic patches, demonstrating successive formation and eruptions of helical flux ropes.

The anisotropy preserves the parity symmetry of the original model. We derive the corresponding-function, which yields both the regular and exceptional eigenvalues. The exceptional eigenvalues correspond to the crossing points of two energy levels with different parities and are doubly degenerate. We find analytically that the ground-state and the first excited state can cross several times, indicating multiple first-order phase transitions as function of the coupling strength. These crossing points are related to manifest parity symmetry of the Hamiltonian, in contrast to the level crossings in the asymmetric quantum Rabi model which are caused by a hidden symmetry.	pacs:42.50.Pq | 03.65.Yz | 71.36.+c | 72.15.Qm

ZhaoSchool of Mathematics and StatisticsCarleton University, Ottawa, ON Canada K1S 5B6			In this paper, we construct a bound copula, which can reach both Frechet’s lower and upper bounds for perfect positive and negative dependence cases. Since it covers a wide range of dependency and simple for computational purposes, it can be very useful. We then develop a new perturbed copula using the lower and upper bounds of Frechet copula and show that it satisfies all properties of a copula. In some cases, it is very difficult to get results such as distribution functions and the expected values in explicit form by using copulas such as Archemedes, Guassian,-copula. Thus, we can use these new copulas. For both copulas, we derive the strength of measures of the dependency such as Spearman’s rho, Kendall’s tau, Blomqvist’s beta and Gini’s gamma, and the coefficients of the tail dependency. As an application, we use the bound copula to analyze the dependency between two service times to evaluate the mean waiting time and the mean service time when customers launch two replicas of each task on two parallel servers using the cancel-on-finish policy. We assume that the inter-arrival time is exponential and the service time is general.	
[2101.12402] Estimating value at risk and conditional tail expectation for extreme and aggregate risks	Suman ThapaSchool of Mathematics and StatisticsCarleton University, Ottawa, ON Canada K1S 5B6Yiqiang Q. ZhaoSchool of Mathematics and StatisticsCarleton University, Ottawa, ON Canada K1S 5B6			In this paper, we investigate risk measures such as value at risk (VaR) and the conditional tail expectation (CTE) of the extreme (maximum and minimum) and the aggregate (total) of two dependent risks. In finance, insurance and the other fields, when people invest their money in two or more dependent or independent markets, it is very important to know the extreme and total risk before the investment. To find these risk measures for dependent cases is quite challenging, which has not been reported in the literature to the best of our knowledge. We use the FGM copula for modelling the dependence as it is relatively simple for computational purposes and has empirical successes. The marginal of the risks are considered as exponential and pareto, separately, for the case of extreme risk and as exponential for the case of the total risk. The effect of the degree of dependency on the VaR and CTE of the extreme and total risks is analyzed. We also make comparisons for the dependent and independent risks. Moreover, we propose a new risk measure called median of tail (MoT) and investigate MoT for the extreme and aggregate dependent risks.	
[2101.12403] Fair Resource Allocation for Demands with Sharp Lower Tail Inequalities	Vacharapat Mettanant Jittat Fakcharoenphol	Email: Department of Computer Engineering Kasetsart University Sriracha Campus Chonburi Thailand. Supported by Faculty of Engineering at Sriracha Graduate Scholarship Kasetsart University.	jittat@gmail.com vacharapat@eng.src.ku.ac.th	We consider a fairness problem in resource allocation where multiple groups demand resources from a common source with the total fixed amount. The general model was introduced by Elzaynet al.[FAT*’19]. We follow Donahue and Kleinberg [FAT*’20] who considered the case when the demand distribution is known. We show that for many common demand distributions that satisfy sharp lower tail inequalities, a natural allocation that provides resources proportional to each group’s average demand performs very well. More specifically, this natural allocation is approximately fair and efficient (i.e., it provides near maximum utilization). We also show that, when small amount of unfairness is allowed, the Price of Fairness (PoF), in this case, is close to 1.	
[2101.12404] Multi-Threshold Attention U-Net (MTAU) based Model for Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation in MRI scans	Navchetan Awasthi Rohit Pardasani Swati Gupta	institutetext:	rohit.r.pardasani@gmail.com navchetanawasthi@gmail.com swati375@gmail.com	Gliomas are one of the most frequent brain tumors and are classified into high grade and low grade gliomas. The segmentation of various regions such as tumor core, enhancing tumor etc. plays an important role in determining severity and prognosis. Here, we have developed a multi-threshold model based on attention U-Net for identification of various regions of the tumor in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We propose a multi-path segmentation and built three separate models for the different regions of interest. The proposed model achieved mean Dice Coefficient of 0.59, 0.72, and 0.61 for enhancing tumor, whole tumor and tumor core respectively on the training dataset. The same model gave mean Dice Coefficient of 0.57, 0.73, and 0.61 on the validation dataset and 0.59, 0.72, and 0.57 on the test dataset.

Devereaux	Department Stanford University Stanford CA 94035 USAStanford Institute for Materials and Energy Sciences (SIMES) SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Menlo Park CA 94025 USA	jamarks@stanford.edu schuelem@stanford.edu	We investigate topological signatures in the short-time non-equilibrium dynamics of symmetry protected topological (SPT) systems starting from initial states which break a protecting symmetry. Naïvely, one might expect that topology loses meaning when a protecting symmetry is broken. Defying this intuition, we illustrate, in an interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, how this combination of symmetry breaking and quench dynamics can give rise to both single-particle and many-body signatures of topology. From the dynamics of the symmetry broken state, we find that we are able to dynamically probe the equilibrium topological phase diagram of a symmetry respecting projection of the post-quench Hamiltonian. In the ensemble dynamics, we demonstrate how spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of a protecting symmetry can result in a quantized many-body topological ‘invariant’ which is not pinned under unitary time evolution. We dub this ‘dynamical many-body topology’ (DMBT). We show numerically that both the pure state and ensemble signatures are remarkably robust, and argue that these non-equilibrium signatures should be quite generic in SPT systems, regardless of protecting symmetries or spatial dimension.	
[2101.12406] Fairness for Whom? Understanding the Reader’s Perception of Fairness in Text Summarization	Anurag Shandilya, Abhisek Dash Abhisek Dash Abhijnan Chakraborty Kripabandhu Ghosh Saptarshi Ghosh	Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur India		With the surge in user-generated textual information, there has been a recent increase in the use of summarization algorithms for providing an overview of the extensive content. Traditional metrics for evaluation of these algorithms (e.g. ROUGE scores) rely on matching algorithmic summaries to human-generated ones. However, it has been shown that when the textual contents are heterogeneous, e.g., when they come from different socially salient groups, most existing summarization algorithms represent the social groups very differently compared to their distribution in the original data. To mitigate such adverse impacts, some fairness-preserving summarization algorithms have also been proposed. All of these studies have considered normative notions of fairness from the perspective of writers of the contents, neglecting the readers’ perceptions of the underlying fairness notions. To bridge this gap, in this work, we study the interplay between the fairness notions and how readers perceive them in textual summaries. Through our experiments, we show that reader’s perception of fairness is often context-sensitive. Moreover, standard ROUGE evaluation metrics are unable to quantify the perceived (un)fairness of the summaries. To this end, we propose a human-in-the-loop metric and an automated graph-based methodology to quantify the perceived bias in textual summaries. We demonstrate their utility by quantifying the (un)fairness of several summaries of heterogeneous socio-political microblog datasets.111This work has been accepted at International Workshop on Fair and Interpretable Learning Algorithms 2020 (FILA 2020), which was held in conjunction with IEEE BigData 2020.

[2101.12408] A Momentum-Conserving Implicit Material Point Method for Surface Energies with Spatial Gradients	Jingyu Chen Victoria Kala Alan Marquez-Razon Elias Gueidon David A. B. Hyde Joseph Teran	UCLAUSA		We present a novel Material Point Method (MPM) discretization of surface tension forces that arise from spatially varying surface energies. These variations typically arise from surface energy dependence on temperature and/or concentration. Furthermore, since the surface energy is an interfacial property depending on the types of materials on either side of an interface, spatial variation is required for modeling the contact angle at the triple junction between a liquid, solid and surrounding air. Our discretization is based on the surface energy itself, rather than on the associated traction condition most commonly used for discretization with particle methods. Our energy based approach automatically captures surface gradients without the explicit need to resolve them as in traction condition based approaches. We include an implicit discretization of thermomechanical material coupling with a novel particle-based enforcement of Robin boundary conditions associated with convective heating. Lastly, we design a particle resampling approach needed to achieve perfect conservation of linear and angular momentum with Affine-Particle-In-Cell (APIC)(Jiang et al.,2015). We show that our approach enables implicit time stepping for complex behaviors like the Marangoni effect and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. We demonstrate the robustness and utility of our method by simulating materials that exhibit highly diverse degrees of surface tension and thermomechanical effects, such as water, wine and wax.

[2101.12409] Few-Shot Domain Adaptation for Grammatical Error Correction via Meta-Learning	Shengsheng Zhang1,2, Yaping Huang1, Yun Chen3, Liner Yang2,Chencheng Wang4, Erhong Yang21Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China2Beijing Language and Culture University, Beijing, China3Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai, China4Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China			Most existing Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) methods based on sequence-to-sequence mainly focus on how to generate more pseudo data to obtain better performance. Few work addresses few-shot GEC domain adaptation. In this paper, we treat different GEC domains as different GEC tasks and propose to extend meta-learning to few-shot GEC domain adaptation without using any pseudo data. We exploit a set of data-rich source domains to learn the initialization of model parameters that facilitates fast adaptation on new resource-poor target domains. We adapt GEC model to the first language (L1) of the second language learner. To evaluate the proposed method, we use nine L1s as source domains and five L1s as target domains. Experiment results on the L1 GEC domain adaptation dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the multi-task transfer learning baseline by 0.50score on average and enables us to effectively adapt to a new L1 domain with only 200 parallel sentences.

We show that geodesic based contact curves generated on both the contacting surfaces are sufficient conditions to ensure rolling. The differential geodesic equations, when modified, can ensure proper disturbance rejection in case the system of interacting bodies is perturbed from the desired curve. A corollary states that geodesic curves are generated on the surface if rolling constraints are satisfied. Simulations in the context of in-hand manipulations of the objects are used as examples.

[2101.12414] Low Rank Forecasting	Shane Barratt Yining Dong Stephen Boyd			We consider the problem of forecasting multiple values of the future of a vector time series, using some past values. This problem, and related ones such as one-step-ahead prediction, have a very long history, and there are a number of well-known methods for it, including vector auto-regressive models, state-space methods, multi-task regression, and others. Our focus is on low rank forecasters, which break forecasting up into two steps: estimating a vector that can be interpreted as a latent state, given the past, and then estimating the future values of the time series, given the latent state estimate. We introduce the concept of forecast consistency, which means that the estimates of the same value made at different times are consistent. We formulate the forecasting problem in general form, and focus on linear forecasters, for which we propose a formulation that can be solved via convex optimization. We describe a number of extensions and variations, including nonlinear forecasters, data weighting, the inclusion of auxiliary data, and additional objective terms. We illustrate our methods with several examples.

In this paper, we study the placement of power beacons (PBs) in bistatic backscatter networks to maximize the guaranteed coverage distance (GCD), defined as the distance from the reader within which backscatter devices are able to satisfy a given quality-of-service constraint. This work departs from conventional energy source placement problems by considering the performance of the additional backscatter link on top of the energy transfer link. We adopt and optimize a symmetric PB placement scheme to maximize the GCD. The optimal PB placement under this scheme is obtained using either analytically tractable expressions or an efficient algorithm. Numerical results provide useful insights into the impacts of various system parameters on the PB placement and the resulting GCD, plus the advantages of the adopted symmetric placement scheme over other benchmark schemes.

[2101.12416] Covariance Prediction via Convex Optimization	Shane Barratt Stephen Boyd			We consider the problem of predicting the covariance of a zero mean Gaussian vector, based on another feature vector. We describe a covariance predictor that has the form of a generalized linear model,i.e., an affine function of the features followed by an inverse link function that maps vectors to symmetric positive definite matrices. The log-likelihood is a concave function of the predictor parameters, so fitting the predictor involves convex optimization. Such predictors can be combined with others, or recursively applied to improve performance.

[2101.12418] Carbon nanotubes collapse phase diagram with arbitrary number of walls. Collapse modes and macroscopic analog.	Y. Magnin F. Rondepierre W. Cui D.J. Dunstan A. San-Miguel		alfonso.san-miguel@univ-lyon1.fr magnin@mit.edu	Carbon nanotubes tend to collapse when their diameters exceed a certain threshold, or when a sufficiently large external pressure is applied on their walls. Their radial stability of tubes has been studied in each of these cases, however a general theory able to predict collapse is still lacking. Here, we propose a simple model predicting stability limits as a function of the tube diameter, the number of walls and the pressure. The model is supported by atomistic simulations, experiments, and is used to plot collapse phase diagrams. We have identified the most stable carbon nanotube, which can support a maximum pressure of18 GPa before collapsing. The latter was identified as a multiwall tube with an internal tube diameter of12nm and30 walls. This maximum pressure is lowered depending on the internal tube diameter and the number of walls. We then identify a tube diameter domain in which the radial mechanical stability can be treated as equivalent to macroscopic tubes, known to be described by the canonical Lévy-Carrier law. This multiscale behavior is shown to be in good agreement with experiments based on O-ring gaskets collapse, proposed as a simple macroscopic parallel to nanotubes in this domain.

O’NeillSchool of Physics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, AustraliaOzGrav, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia	E-mail:	pat.meyers@unimelb.edu.au	It is an open challenge to estimate systematically the physical parameters of neutron star interiors from pulsar timing data while separating spin wandering intrinsic to the pulsar (achromatic timing noise) from measurement noise and chromatic timing noise (due to propagation effects). In this paper we formulate the classic two-component, crust-superfluid model of neutron star interiors as a noise-driven, linear dynamical system and use a state-space-based expectation-maximization method to estimate the system parameters using gravitational-wave and electromagnetic timing data. Monte Carlo simulations show that we can accurately estimate all six parameters of the two-component model provided that electromagnetic measurements of the crust angular velocity, and gravitational-wave measurements of the core angular velocity, are both available. When only electromagnetic data are available we can recover the overall relaxation time-scale, the ensemble-averaged spin-down rate, and the strength of the white-noise torque on the crust. However, the estimates of the secular torques on the two components and white noise torque on the superfluid are biased significantly.	stars: neutron – pulsars: general – methods: data analysis

However, it is still uncertain about the physics of MB, and there are various proposed scenarios for MB in the literature. To examine and discriminate the efficiency of MB, we investigate the LMXB evolution with five proposed MB laws. Combining detailed binary evolution calculation with binary population synthesis, we obtain the expected properties of LMXBs and their descendants binary millisecond pulsars. We then discuss the strength and weakness of each MB law by comparing the calculated results with observations. We conclude that the-boosted MB law seems to best match the observational characteristics.	stars: evolution – stars: neutron – pulsars: individual: magnetic braking – X-rays: binaries

Particularly, we first introduce a federated-blockchain system together with a cross-chain transfer protocol to facilitate the secure and decentralized transfer of tokens between chains. We then develop a novel PoS-based consensus mechanism for FedChain, which can satisfy strict security requirements, prevent various blockchain-specific attacks, and achieve a more desirable performance compared to those of other existing consensus mechanisms. Moreover, a Stackelberg game model is developed to examine and address the problem of centralization in the FedChain system. Furthermore, the game model can enhance the security and performance of FedChain. By analyzing interactions between the stakeholders and chain operators, we can prove the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium and find the exact formula for this equilibrium. These results are especially important for the stakeholders to determine their best investment strategies and for the chain operators to design the optimal policy to maximize their benefits and security protection for FedChain. Simulations results then clearly show that the FedChain framework can help stakeholders to maximize their profits and the chain operators to design appropriate parameters to enhance FedChain’s security and performance.

E-mail: {shobha gaurav18160 		We propose an analytical framework based on stochastic geometry (SG) formulations to estimate a radar’s detection performance under generalized discrete clutter conditions. We model the spatial distribution of discrete clutter scatterers as a homogeneous Poisson point process and the radar cross-section of each extended scatterer as a random variable of the Weibull distribution. Using this framework, we derive a metric called the radar detection coverage probability as a function of radar parameters such as transmitted power, system noise temperature and radar bandwidth; and clutter parameters such as clutter density and mean clutter cross-section. We derive the optimum radar bandwidth for maximizing this metric under noisy and cluttered conditions. We also derive the peak transmitted power beyond which there will be no discernible improvement in radar detection performance due to clutter limited conditions. When both transmitted power and bandwidth are fixed, we show how the detection threshold can be optimized for best performance. We experimentally validate the SG results with a hybrid of Monte Carlo and full wave electromagnetic solver based simulations using finite difference time domain (FDTD) techniques.	stochastic geometry | radar detection | FDTD | Monte Carlo simulations | indoor clutter | Poisson point process
[2101.12430] Subgraph nomination: Query by Example Subgraph Retrieval in Networks	Al-Fahad M. Al-Qadhi Carey E. Priebe Hayden S. Helm Vince LyzinskiUniversity of Maryland, College Park, Department of MathematicsJohns Hopkins University, Department of Applied Mathematics and StatisticsJohns Hopkins University, Center for Imaging Science			This paper introduces the subgraph nomination inference task, in which example subgraphs of interest are used to query a network for similarly interesting subgraphs. This type of problem appears time and again in real world problems connected to, for example, user recommendation systems and structural retrieval tasks in social and biological/connectomic networks. We formally define the subgraph nomination framework with an emphasis on the notion of a user-in-the-loop in the subgraph nomination pipeline. In this setting, a user can provide additional post-nomination light supervision that can be incorporated into the retrieval task. After introducing and formalizing the retrieval task, we examine the nuanced effect that user-supervision can have on performance, both analytically and across real and simulated data examples.	
[2101.12431] Learning Twofold Heterogeneous Multi-Task by Sharing Similar Convolution Kernel Pairs	Quan Feng Songcan Chen	of Computer ScienceTechnology Nanjing University of AeronauticsAstronautics Nanjing Jiangsu 211106 ChinaMIIT Key Laboratory of Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence Nanjing University of AeronauticsAstronautics Nanjing Jiangsu 211106 China	s.chen@nuaa.edu.cn	Heterogeneous multi-task learning (HMTL) is an important topic in multi-task learning (MTL). Most existing HMTL methods usually solve either scenario where all tasks reside in the same input (feature) space yet unnecessarily the consistent output (label) space or scenario where their input (feature) spaces are heterogeneous while the output (label) space is consistent. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is limited study on twofold heterogeneous MTL (THMTL) scenario where the input and the output spaces are both inconsistent or heterogeneous. In order to handle this complicated scenario, in this paper, we design a simple and effective multi-task adaptive learning (MTAL) network to learn multiple tasks in such THMTL setting. Specifically, we explore and utilize the inherent relationship between tasks for knowledge sharing from similar convolution kernels in individual layers of the MTAL network. Then in order to realize the sharing, we weightedly aggregate any pair of convolutional kernels with their similarity greater than some threshold, consequently, our model effectively performs cross-task learning while suppresses the intra-redundancy of the entire network. Finally, we conduct end-to-end training. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison with the state-of-the-art counterparts.	heterogeneous tasks | multi-task learning | parameter sharing

Therefore, they should have very circular orbits. However, the discovery of several eccentric binary MSPs (with eccentricity) challenges this standard picture. Three models have been proposed thus far based on accretion-induced collapse of massive white dwarfs (WDs), neutron star-strange star transition, and formation of circumbinary disks. All of them are subject to various uncertainties, and are not entirely consistent with observations. Here we propose an alternative model taking into account the influence of thermonuclear flashes on proto-WDs. We assume that the flashes lead to asymmetrical mass ejection, which imparts a mild kick on the proto-WDs. By simulating orbital changes of binary MSPs with multiple shell flashes, we show that it is possible to reproduce the observed eccentricities, provided that the kick velocities are around a few kms.	pulsars: general - pulsars: evolution - white dwarfs

Kim is with the College of Software Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) Suwon Korea (e-mail:	hyoung@skku.edu	Ransomware is a growing threat that typically operates by either encrypting a victim’s files or locking a victim’s computer until the victim pays a ransom. However, it is still challenging to detect such malware timely with existing traditional malware detection techniques. In this paper, we present a novel ransomware detection system, called “Peeler” (Profiling kErnEl -LevelEvents to detectRansomware). Peeler deviates from signatures for individual ransomware samples and relies on common and generic characteristics of ransomware depicted at the kernel-level. Analyzing diverse ransomware families, we observed ransomware’s inherent behavioral characteristics such as stealth operations performed before the attack, file I/O request patterns, process spawning, and correlations among kernel-level events. Based on those characteristics, we develop Peeler that continuously monitors a target system’s kernel events and detects ransomware attacks on the system. Our experimental results show that Peeler achieves more than 99% detection rate with 0.58% false-positive rate against 43 distinct ransomware families, containing samples from both crypto and screen-locker types of ransomware. For crypto ransomware, Peeler detects them promptly after only one file is lost (within 115 milliseconds on average). Peeler utilizes around 4.9% of CPU time with only 9.8 MB memory under the normal workload condition. Our analysis demonstrates that Peeler can efficiently detect diverse malware families by monitoring their kernel-level events.

We summarize the theoretical predictions for the decay widths of the SM Higgs boson and those of Higgs bosons appearing in its extensions taking account of all possible decay modes. We incorporate them to study and analyze decay patterns of CP-even, CP-odd, and CP-mixed neutral Higgs bosons and charged ones. We put special focus on the properties of a neutral Higgs boson with mass about 125 GeV discovered at the LHC and present constraints obtained from precision analysis of it. This review is intended to be self-contained and consolidated by coherently integrating relevant physics information for studying decays of Higgs bosons in the SM and beyond.	
[2101.12436] Channel Measurement and Ray-Tracing-Statistical Hybrid Modeling for Low-Terahertz Indoor Communications	Yi Chen  Yuanbo Li Chong Han  Ziming Yu and Guangjian Wang			TeraHertz (THz) communications are envisioned as a promising technology, owing to its unprecedented multi-GHz bandwidth. One fundamental challenge when moving to new spectrum is to understand the science of radio propagation and develop an accurate channel model. In this paper, a wideband channel measurement campaign between 130 GHz and 143 GHz is investigated in a typical meeting room. Directional antennas are utilized and rotated for resolving the multi-path components (MPCs) in the angular domain. With careful system calibration that eliminates system errors and antenna effects, a realistic power delay profile is developed. Furthermore, a combined MPC clustering and matching procedure with ray-tracing techniques is proposed to investigate the cluster behavior and wave propagation of THz signals. In light of the measurement results, physical parameters and insights in the THz indoor channel are comprehensively analyzed, including the line-of-sight path loss, power distributions, temporal and spatial features, and correlations among THz multi-path characteristics. Finally, a hybrid channel model that combines ray-tracing and statistical methods is developed for THz indoor communications. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid channel model shows good agreement with the measurement and outperforms the conventional statistical and geometric-based stochastic channel model in terms of the temporal-spatial characteristics.

Cheng is with the Institute of Electronics National Chiao Tung Univresity Hsinchu 300 Taiwan and the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Program National Chung Hsing University Taichung 400 Taiwan. E-mail:	whcheng@nctu.edu.tw	In this paper, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal convolutional Dense Network (STDNet) to address the video-based crowd counting problem, which contains the decomposition of 3D convolution and the 3D spatiotemporal dilated dense convolution to alleviate the rapid growth of the model size caused by the Conv3D layer. Moreover, since the dilated convolution extracts the multiscale features, we combine the dilated convolution with the channel attention block to enhance the feature representations. Due to the error that occurs from the difficulty of labeling crowds, especially for videos, imprecise or standard-inconsistent labels may lead to poor convergence for the model. To address this issue, we further propose a new patch-wise regression loss (PRL) to improve the original pixel-wise loss. Experimental results on three video-based benchmarks, i.e., the UCSD, Mall and WorldExpo’10 datasets, show that STDNet outperforms both image- and video-based state-of-the-art methods.

[2101.12442] Finding the Sweet Spot for Data Anonymization: A Mechanism Design Perspective	Abdelrahman Eldosouky, Tapadhir Das, Anuraag Kotra, and Shamik Sengupta	This paper is an extension of the work originally presented in[1]		Data sharing between different organizations is an essential process in today’s connected world. However, recently there were many concerns about data sharing as sharing sensitive information can jeopardize users’ privacy. To preserve the privacy, organizations use anonymization techniques to conceal users’ sensitive data. However, these techniques are vulnerable to de-anonymization attacks which aim to identify individual records within a dataset. In this paper, a two-tier mathematical framework is proposed for analyzing and mitigating the de-anonymization attacks, by studying the interactions between sharing organizations, data collector, and a prospective attacker. In the first level, a game-theoretic model is proposed to enable sharing organizations to optimally select their anonymization levels for k-anonymization under two potential attacks: background-knowledge attack and homogeneity attack. In the second level, a contract-theoretic model is proposed to enable the data collector to optimally reward the organizations for their data. The formulated problems are studied under single-time sharing and repeated sharing scenarios. Different Nash equilibria for the proposed game and the optimal solution of the contract-based problem are analytically derived for both scenarios. Simulation results show that the organizations can optimally select their anonymization levels, while the data collector can benefit from incentivizing the organizations to share their data.

Eugene Stanley Daniel Dajun Zeng	School of Data Science City University of Hong Kong Hong Kong SAR China	qingpeng.zhang@cityu.edu.hk	The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a dramatic surge in demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) worldwide. Many countries have imposed export restrictions on PPE to ensure the sufficient domestic supply. The surging demand and export restrictions cause shortage contagions on the global PPE trade network. Here, we develop an integrated network model, which integrates a metapopulation model and a threshold model, to investigate the shortage contagion patterns. The metapopulation model captures disease contagion across countries. The threshold model captures the shortage contagion on the global PPE trade network. Results show that, the shortage contagion patterns are mainly decided by top exporters. Export restrictions exacerbate the shortages of PPE and cause the shortage contagion to transmit even faster than the disease contagion. Besides, export restrictions lead to ineffective and inefficient allocation of PPE around the world, which has no benefits for the world to fight against the pandemic.

E-mail:	shobha@iiitd.ac.in	Narrowband and broadband indoor radar images significantly deteriorate in the presence of target dependent and independent static and dynamic clutter arising from walls. A stacked and sparse denoising autoencoder (StackedSDAE) is proposed for mitigating wall clutter in indoor radar images. The algorithm relies on the availability of clean images and corresponding noisy images during training and requires no additional information regarding the wall characteristics. The algorithm is evaluated on simulated Doppler-time spectrograms and high range resolution profiles generated for diverse radar frequencies and wall characteristics in around-the-corner radar (ACR) scenarios. Additional experiments are performed on range-enhanced frontal images generated from measurements gathered from a wideband RF imaging sensor. The results from the experiments show that the StackedSDAE successfully reconstructs images that closely resemble those that would be obtained in free space conditions. Further, the incorporation of sparsity and depth in the hidden layer representations within the autoencoder makes the algorithm more robust to low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and label mismatch between clean and corrupt data during training than the conventional single layer DAE. For example, the denoised ACR signatures show a structural similarity above 0.75 to clean free space images at SNR ofand label mismatch error of 50%.

Olson Roli Khanna Lawrence Neal Fuxin Li Weng-Keen Wong		olsomatt@eecs.oregonstate.edu	Counterfactual explanations, which deal with “why not?” scenarios, can provide insightful explanations to an AI agent’s behavior((Miller,2019]. In this work, we focus on generating counterfactual explanations for deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents which operate in visual input environments like Atari. We introducecounterfactualstateexplanations, a novel example-based approach to counterfactual explanations based on generative deep learning. Specifically, a counterfactual state illustrates what minimal change is needed to an Atari game image such that the agent chooses a different action. We also evaluate the effectiveness of counterfactual states on human participants who are not machine learning experts. Our first user study investigates if humans can discern if the counterfactual state explanations are produced by the actual game or produced by a generative deep learning approach. Our second user study investigates if counterfactual state explanations can help non-expert participants identify a flawed agent; we compare against a baseline approach based on a nearest neighbor explanation which uses images from the actual game. Our results indicate that counterfactual state explanations have sufficient fidelity to the actual game images to enable non-experts to more effectively identify a flawed RL agent compared to the nearest neighbor baseline and to having no explanation at all.

[2101.12447] The Mind’s Eye: Visualizing Class-Agnostic Features of CNNs				Visual interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has gained significant popularity because of the great challenges that CNN complexity imposes to understanding their inner workings. Although many techniques have been proposed to visualize class features of CNNs, most of them do not provide a correspondence between inputs and the extracted features in specific layers. This prevents the discovery of stimuli that each layer responds better to. We propose an approach to visually interpret CNN features given a set of images by creating corresponding images that depict the most informative features of a specific layer. Exploring features in this class-agnostic manner allows for a greater focus on the feature extractor of CNNs. Our method uses a dual-objective activation maximization and distance minimization loss, without requiring a generator network nor modifications to the original model. This limits the number of FLOPs to that of the original network. We demonstrate the visualization quality on widely-used architectures.111Code is available athttps://git.io/JL9Wgand our demo video:https://youtu.be/Au3jaUdnPKM

[2101.12454] How flux feeding causes eruptions of solar magnetic flux ropes with the hyperbolic flux tube configuration?	Quanhao Zhang Rui Liu Yuming Wang Zhenjun Zhou Bin Zhuang Xiaolei Li	institutetext:	zhangqh@ustc.edu.cn	Coronal magnetic flux ropes are generally considered to be the core structure of large-scale solar eruptions. Recent observations found that solar eruptions could be initiated by a sequence of “flux feeding,” during which chromospheric fibrils rise upward from below, and merge with a pre-existing prominence. Further theoretical study has confirmed that the flux feeding mechanism is efficient in causing the eruption of flux ropes that are wrapped by bald patch separatrix surfaces. But it is unclear how flux feeding influences coronal flux ropes that are wrapped by hyperbolic flux tubes (HFT), and whether it is able to cause the flux-rope eruption. In this paper, we use a 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model to simulate the flux feeding processes in HFT configurations. It is found that flux feeding injects axial magnetic flux into the flux rope, whereas the poloidal flux of the rope is reduced after flux feeding. Flux feeding is able to cause the flux rope to erupt, provided that the injected axial flux is large enough so that the critical axial flux of the rope is reached. Otherwise, the flux rope system evolves to a stable equilibrium state after flux feeding, which might be even farther away from the onset of the eruption, indicating that flux feeding could stabilize the rope system with the HFT configuration in this circumstance.

In this way, high range resolution profiles (HRRP) can be obtained without increasing the hardware system cost. Furthermore, the agility provides improved both robustness to jamming and spectrum efficiency. Motivated by the Newtonalized orthogonal matching pursuit (NOMP) for line spectral estimation problem, the NOMP for the FAR radar termed as NOMP-FAR is designed to process each coarse range bin to extract the HRRP and velocities of multiple targets, including the guide for determining the oversampling factor and the stopping criterion. In addition, it is shown that the target will cause false alarm in the nearby coarse range bins, a postprocessing algorithm is then proposed to suppress the ghost targets. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of NOMP-FAR.	Newtonalized orthogonal matching pursuit | frequency agile radar | oversampling factor | false alarm

While new-coming users continuously arrive in the real world, one crucial task is to haveinductiveSR that can produce embeddings of users and items without re-training. Given user-item interactions can be extremely sparse, another critical task is to havetransferableSR that can transfer the knowledge derived from one domain with rich data to another domain. In this work, we aim to present theholistic SRthat simultaneously accommodates conventional, inductive, and transferable settings. We propose a novel deep learning-based model,Relational Temporal Attentive Graph Neural Networks(RetaGNN), for holistic SR. The main idea of RetaGNN is three-fold. First, to have inductive and transferable capabilities, we train arelational attentive GNNon the local subgraph extracted from a user-item pair, in which the learnable weight matrices are on various relations among users, items, and attributes, rather than nodes or edges. Second, long-term and short-term temporal patterns of user preferences are encoded by a proposedsequential self-attentionmechanism.

[2101.12458] Critique on “Volume penalization for inhomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions modeling scalar flux in complicated geometry”	Ramakrishnan Thirumalaisamy Nishant Nangia Amneet Pal Singh Bhalla	of Mechanical Engineering San Diego State University San Diego CA	asbhalla@sdsu.edu	Numerical simulation of multiphysics problems within complex domains has garnered much interest in the past couple of decades. In the seminal work by Angot et al.Angot1999, the authors describe a simple approach for simulating the incompressible flow over obstacles by applying an additional forcing term to the governing equations. InAngot1999, this volume penalization (VP) methodology (also known as the Brinkman penalization method) was used to impose no-slip Dirichlet boundary conditions at the obstacle interface. Due to the simplicity of its formulation and implementation, the VP technique has been successfully applied to study a variety of fluid-structure interaction problems, including but not limited to water entry/exitBhallaBP2019, wave energy conversionDafnakis2020;khedkar2020inertial, aquatic locomotionBergmann2011;Engels2017, fluttering instabilitiesEngels2013, and flapping flight of insectsKolomenskiy2011;Kolomenskiy2013. In all of these applications, the Dirichlet boundary condition formulation of the VP method was used. In the past few years penalization methods for Neumann and more general Robin boundary conditions have been proposed, although the analysis of such techniques is still an active area of researchKadoch2012;Kolomenskiy2015;Brown2014;Hardy2019;Sakurai2019.

[2101.12459] On 𝑓-divergences between Cauchy distributionsThe second author was supported by JSPS KAKENHI 19K14549.	Frank NielsenSony Computer Science Laboratories  Kazuki OkamuraDepartment of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Shizuoka	thanks:	Frank.Nielsen@acm.org okamura.kazuki@shizuoka.ac.jp	We prove that the-divergences between univariate Cauchy distributions are all symmetric, and can be expressed as strictly increasing scalar functions of the symmetric chi-squared divergence. We report the corresponding scalar functions for the total variation distance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the squared Hellinger divergence, and the Jensen-Shannon divergence among others. Next, we give conditions to expand the-divergences as converging infinite series of higher-order power chi divergences, and illustrate the criterion for converging Taylor series expressing the-divergences between Cauchy distributions. We then show that the symmetric property of-divergences holds for multivariate location-scale families with prescribed matrix scales provided that the standard density is even which includes the cases of the multivariate normal and Cauchy families. However, the-divergences between multivariate Cauchy densities with different scale matrices are shown asymmetric. Finally, we present several metrizations of-divergences between univariate Cauchy distributions and further report geometric embedding properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

The synthetic data have been shown helpful to train better NMT, especially for low-resource language pairs and domains. Nonetheless, large monolingual data in the target domains or languages are not always available to generate large synthetic parallel data. In this work, we propose a new method to generate large synthetic parallel data leveraging very small monolingual data in a specific domain. We fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on such small in-domain monolingual data and use the resulting model to generate a large amount of synthetic in-domain monolingual data. Then, we perform back-translation, or forward translation, to generate synthetic in-domain parallel data. Our preliminary experiments on three language pairs and five domains show the effectiveness of our method to generate fully synthetic but useful in-domain parallel data for improving NMT in all configurations. We also show promising results in extreme adaptation for personalized NMT.

While recent advances exploit graph neural networks (GNN) to better learn spatial and temporal dependencies between sensors, they cannot model time-evolving spatio-temporal correlation (STC) between sensors, and require pre-defined graphs, which are neither always available nor totally reliable, and target at only a specific type of sensor data at one time. Moreover, since the form of time-series fluctuation is varied across sensors, a model needs to learn fluctuation modulation. To tackle these issues, in this work, we propose a novel GNN-based model,Attention-adjusted Graph Spatio-Temporal Network(AGSTN). In AGSTN, multi-graph convolution with sequential learning is developed to learn time-evolving STC. Fluctuation modulation is realized by a proposed attention adjustment mechanism. Experiments on three sensor data, air quality, bike demand, and traffic flow, exhibit that AGSTN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.	graph neural network | spatio-temporial correlation | time series | attention adjustment | urban computing | air quality | traffic flow | bike demand

There is no general solution to identify the relative position and orientation between the peg and the hole. In this paper, we propose a novel method to classify the contact poses based on a sequence of contact measurements. When the peg contacts the hole with pose uncertainties, a tilt-then-rotate strategy is applied, and the contacts are measured as a group of patterns to encode the contact pose. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to classify the contact poses according to the patterns. In the end, an admittance controller guides the peg towards the error direction and finishes the peg-in-hole assembly. Simulations and experiments are provided to show that the proposed method can be applied to the peg-in-hole assembly of different geometries. We also demonstrate the ability to alleviate the sim-to-real gap.

This metric contains post-Newtonian parameters which can be further used to constrain the underlying dynamical theory and quantum state of gravity. For values of the post-Newtonian parameters within experimental bounds, the reconstructed metric appears very close to the Schwarzschild solution of General Relativity in the whole region outside the event horizon. The latter is however larger in size for the same value of the mass compared to the Schwarzschild case.

The federated learning is an effective framework to train a shared model between decentralized edge devices or servers without exchanging raw data, which can help protect data privacy. In UAV-enabled IoT networks, latency and energy consumption are two important metrics limiting the performance of FEEL. Although most of existing works have studied how to reduce the latency and improve the energy efficiency, few works have investigated the impact of limited batteries at the devices on the FEEL. Motivated by this, we study the battery-constrained FEEL, where the UAVs can adjust their operating CPU-frequency to prolong the battery life and avoid withdrawing from federated learning training untimely. We optimize the system by jointly allocating the computational resource and wireless bandwidth in time-varying environments. To solve this optimization problem, we employ a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based strategy, where a linear combination of latency and energy consumption is used to evaluate the system cost. Simulation results are finally demonstrated to show that the proposed strategy outperforms the conventional ones. In particular, it enables all the devices to complete all rounds of FEEL with limited batteries and meanwhile reduce the system cost effectively.

Cellular IoT connects massive number of physical and virtual objects to the Internet using cellular networks. The latest generation of cellular networks, e.g. fifth-generation (5G), use evolutionary and revolutionary technologies to notably improve the performance of wireless networks. However, given the envisioned new use-cases, e.g., holographic communication, and the ever-increasing deployment of massive smart-physical end-devices in IoT, the volume of network traffic has considerably raised, and therefore, the current generation of mobile networks cannot wholly meet the ever-increasing demands. Hence, it is envisioned that the next generation, sixth generation (6G) networks, need to play a critical role to alleviate such challenges in IoT by providing new communication services, network capacity, and ultra-low latency communications (uRLLC). In this paper, first, the need for 6G networks is discussed. Then, the potential 6G requirements and trends, as well as the latest research activities related to 6G are introduced e.g., Tactile Internet and Terahertz (THz). Furthermore, the key performance indicators, applications, new services, and the potential key enabling technologies for 6G networks are presented.

Yang	College of Mathematics and Physics Beijing University of Chemical Technology Beijing 100029 China	zhiming_yu@bit.edu.cn	Nodal lines, as one-dimensional band degeneracies in momentum space, usually feature a linear energy splitting. Here, we propose the concept of magnetic higher-order nodal lines, which are nodal lines with higher-order energy splitting and realized in magnetic systems with broken time reversal symmetry. We provide sufficient symmetry conditions for stabilizing magnetic quadratic and cubic nodal lines, based on which concrete lattice models are constructed to demonstrate their existence. Unlike its counterpart in nonmagnetic systems, the magnetic quadratic nodal line can exist as the only band degeneracy at the Fermi level. We show that these nodal lines can be accompanied by torus surface states, which form a surface band that span over the whole surface Brillouin zone. Under symmetry breaking, these magnetic nodal lines can be transformed into a variety of interesting topological states, such as three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall insulator, multiple linear nodal lines, and magnetic triple-Weyl semimetal. The three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall insulator features a Hall conductivityquantized in unit ofwhereis the lattice constant normal to the-plane. Our work reveals previously unknown topological states, and offers guidance to search for them in realistic material systems.

[2101.12482] Self-Supervised Pretraining for RGB-D Salient Object Detection	Xiaoqi Zhao,1Youwei Pang,1Lihe Zhang,1Huchuan Lu,1,2Xiang Ruan3	Corresponding author.		Existing CNNs-Based RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) networks are all required to be pretrained on the ImageNet to learn the hierarchy features which helps provide a good initialization. However, the collection and annotation of large-scale datasets are time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we utilize self-supervised representation learning (SSL) to design two pretext tasks: the cross-modal auto-encoder and the depth-contour estimation. Our pretext tasks require only a few and unlabeled RGB-D datasets to perform pretraining, which makes the network capture rich semantic contexts and reduce the gap between two modalities, thereby providing an effective initialization for the downstream task. In addition, for the inherent problem of cross-modal fusion in RGB-D SOD, we propose a consistency-difference aggregation (CDA) module that splits a single feature fusion into multi-path fusion to achieve an adequate perception of consistent and differential information. The CDA module is general and suitable for cross-modal and cross-level feature fusion. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show that our self-supervised pretrained model performs favorably against most state-of-the-art methods pretrained on ImageNet.

Nitani Y. Takeichi A. Anspoks		kato-seiya@hiroshima-u.ac.jp	For the first time, the dielectric response of a BaTiOthin film under an AC electric field is investigated using microsecond time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Ti K-edge in order to clarify correlated contributions of each constituent atom on the electronic states. Intensities of the pre-edgepeak and shoulder structure just below the main edge increase with an increase in the amplitude of the applied electric field, whereas that of the main peak decreases in an opposite manner. Based on the multiple scattering theory, the increase and decrease of theand main peaks are simulated for different Ti off-center displacements. Our results indicate that these spectral features reflect the inter- and intra-atomic hybridization of Ti 3with O 2and Ti 4, respectively. In contrast, the shoulder structure is not affected by changes in the Ti off-center displacement but is susceptible to the effect of the corner site Ba ions. This is the first experimental verification of electronic contribution of Ba to polarization reversal.

Lizunov11footnotetext:Corresponding author.	footnotetext:		The ambipolar electrostatic potential rising along the magnetic field line from the grounded wall to the centre in the linear gas dynamic trap, rules the available suppression of axial heat and particle losses. In this paper, the visible range optical diagnostic is described using the Doppler shift of plasma emission lines for measurements of this accelerating potential drop. We used the room temperature hydrogen jet puffed directly on the line of sight as the charge exchange target for plasma ions moving in the expanding flux from the mirror towards the wall. Both bulk plasma protons andions velocity distribution functions can be spectroscopically studied; the latter population is produced via the neutral He tracer puff into the central cell plasma. This way, potential in the centre and in the mirror area can be measured simultaneously along with the ion temperature. A reasonable accuracy ofwas achieved in observations with the frame rate of. Active acquisitions on the gas jet also provide the spatial resolution better than 5 mm in the middle plane radial coordinate because of the strong compression of the object size when projected to the centre along the magnetic flux surface. The charge exchange radiation diagnostic operates with three emission lines: H-656.3 nm, He-I 667.8 nm and He-I 587.6 nm. Recorded spectra are shown in the paper and examples for physical dependences are presented. The considered experimental technique can be scaled to the upgraded multi-point diagnostic for the next generation linear traps and other magnetic confinement systems.

Using bosonization, the replica formalism and the nonperturbative functional renormalization group, we find that the ground state is unstable to any modification of the disorder configuration (“disorder” chaos) or variation of the Luttinger parameter (“quantum” chaos, analog to the “temperature” chaos in classical disordered systems). This result is obtained by considering two copies of the system, with slightly different disorder configurations or Luttinger parameters, and showing that inter-copy statistical correlations are suppressed at length scales larger than an overlap length(is a measure of the difference between the disorder distributions or Luttinger parameters of the two copies). The chaos exponentcan be obtained by computingor by studying the instability of the Bose-glass fixed point for the two-copy system when. The renormalized, functional, inter-copy disorder correlator departs from its fixed-point value – characterized by cuspy singularities –viaa chaos boundary layer, in the same way as it approaches the Bose-glass fixed point whenthrough a quantum boundary layer. Performing a linear analysis of perturbations about the Bose-glass fixed point, we find.

Untouched possible mechanisms of spin-2 spacetime perturbations production, we will consider their subsequent scattering on other black holes (BHs). Specifically, we consider a generalization of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations for the case of distorted BHs (BHs surrounded with matter) in Minkowski and Anti-de Sitter spacetimes, the metric potential of which obeys the Liouville equation. We establish significant differences in scattering characteristics of waves of different spins and angular momenta, including the gravitational waves, caused by losing the spherical symmetry of their propagation background. In particular, we demonstrate the strong impact of the background geometry deformation on the grey-body factors, hence on the absorption cross-sections of scattering waves, and explore the issue of stability of the background geometry upon changing the deformation degree parameters.

[2101.12490] Moment-Based Exact Uncertainty Propagation Through Nonlinear Stochastic Autonomous Systems	Ashkan Jasour, Allen Wang, and Brian C. WilliamsComputer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology {jasour, allenw, williams} @ mit.edu			In this paper, we address the problem of uncertainty propagation through nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. More precisely, given a discrete-time continuous-state probabilistic nonlinear dynamical system, we aim at finding the sequence of the moments of the probability distributions of the system states up to any desired order over the given planning horizon. Moments of uncertain states can be used in estimation, planning, control, and safety analysis of stochastic dynamical systems. Existing approaches to address moment propagation problems provide approximate descriptions of the moments and are mainly limited to particular set of uncertainties, e.g., Gaussian disturbances. In this paper, to describe the moments of uncertain states, we introduce trigonometric and also mixed-trigonometric-polynomial moments. Such moments allow us to obtain closed deterministic dynamical systems that describe theexacttime evolution of the moments of uncertain states of an important class of autonomous and robotic systems including underwater, ground, and aerial vehicles, robotic arms and walking robots. Such obtained deterministic dynamical systems can be used, in a receding horizon fashion, to propagate the uncertainties over the planning horizon inreal-time. To illustrate the performance of the proposed method, we benchmark our method against existing approaches including linear, unscented transformation, and sampling based uncertainty propagation methods that are widely used in estimation, prediction, planning, and control problems.

That is highly inefficient and for large datasets implies a massive redundancy of features detectors. Even though capsules networks are still in their infancy, they constitute a promising solution to extend current convolutional networks and endow artificial visual perception with a process to encode more efficiently all feature affine transformations. Indeed, a properly working capsule network should theoretically achieve higher results with a considerably lower number of parameters count due to intrinsic capability to generalize to novel viewpoints. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to this relevant aspect. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of capsule networks and, pushing their capacity to the limits with an extreme architecture with barely 160K parameters, we prove that the proposed architecture is still able to achieve state-of-the-art results on three different datasets with only 2% of the original CapsNet parameters. Moreover, we replace dynamic routing with a novel non-iterative, highly parallelizable routing algorithm that can easily cope with a reduced number of capsules. Extensive experimentation with other capsule implementations has proved the effectiveness of our methodology and the capability of capsule networks to efficiently embed visual representations more prone to generalization.	
[2101.12492] A Practical Two-Sample Test for Weighted Random Graphs	Mingao Yuan Qian Wen		mingao.yuan@ndsu.edu qian.wen@ndsu.edu	Network (graph) data analysis is a popular research topic in statistics and machine learning. In application, one is frequently confronted with graph two-sample hypothesis testing where the goal is to test the difference between two graph populations. Several statistical tests have been devised for this purpose in the context of binary graphs. However, many of the practical networks are weighted and existing procedures can’t be directly applied to weighted graphs. In this paper, we study the weighted graph two-sample hypothesis testing problem and propose a practical test statistic. We prove that the proposed test statistic converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis and analyze its power theoretically. The simulation study shows that the proposed test has satisfactory performance and it substantially outperforms the existing counterpart in the binary graph case. A real data application is provided to illustrate the method.	two-sample hypothesis test | random graph | weighted graph
[2101.12493] Transmission Power Allocation for Remote Estimation with Multi-packet Reception Capabilities	Matthias Pezzutto Luca Schenato Subhrakanti Dey	Department of Information Engineering University of Padova Padova ItalyHamilton Institute National University of Ireland Maynooth County Kildare Ireland	matthias.pezzutto@phd.unipd.it	In this paper we consider the problem of transmission power allocation for remote estimation of a dynamical system in the case where the estimator is able to simultaneously receive packets from multiple interfering sensors, as it is possible e.g. with the latest wireless technologies such as 5G and WiFi. To this end we introduce a general model where packet arrival probabilities are determined based on the received Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio and with two different receivers design schemes, one implementing standard multi-packet reception technique and one implementing Successive Interference Cancellation decoding algorithm in addition. Then we cast the power allocation problem as an optimization task where the mean error covariance at the remote estimator is minimized, while penalizing the mean transmission power consumption. For the infinite-horizon problem we show the existence of a stationary optimal policy, while for the finite-horizon case we derive some structural properties under the special scenario where the overall system to be estimated can be seen as a set of independent subsystems. Numerical simulations illustrate the improvement given by the proposed receivers, especially when SIC is used, over orthogonal schemes that schedule only one sensor transmission at a time in order to avoid interference.

[2101.12497] One-parameter robust global frequency estimator for slowly varying amplitude and noisy oscillations	Michael Ruderman	of Agder 4604-Norway	michael.ruderman@uia.no	Robust online estimation of oscillation frequency belongs to classical problems of system identification and adaptive control. The given harmonic signal can be noisy and with varying amplitude at the same time, as in the case of damped vibrations. A novel robust frequency-estimation algorithm is proposed here, motivated by the existing globally convergent frequency estimator. The advantage of the proposed estimator is in requiring one design parameter only and being robust against measurement noise and initial conditions. The proven global convergence also allows for slowly varying amplitudes, which is useful for applications with damped oscillations or additionally shaped harmonic signals. The proposed analysis is simple and relies on an averaging theory of the periodic signals. Our results show an exponential convergence rate, which depends, analytically, on the sought frequency, adaptation gain and oscillation amplitude. Numerical and experimental examples demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed estimator for signals with slowly varying amplitude and noise.

When one of right-handed neutrinos is lighter than the electroweak scale, it can give a sizable contribution to neutrinoless double beta () decay. We show that the detection of thedecay by future experiments gives a significant implication to the search for such light right-handed neutrino.

O’Callaghan Thomas Brendan Murphy	School of Mathematics & Statistics University College DublinVistamilk SFI Research Centre		In recent years, within the dairy sector, animal diet and management practices have been receiving increased attention, in particular examining the impact of pasture-based feeding strategies on the composition and quality of milk and dairy products, in line with the increased prevalence of premiumgrass-feddairy products appearing on market shelves. To date, there are limited testing methods available for the verification ofgrass-feddairy and as a consequence these products are susceptible to food fraud and adulteration. Therefore, with this in mind, enhanced statistical tools studying potential differences among milk samples coming from animals on different feeding systems are required, thus providing increased security around the authenticity of the products.	
[2101.12500] Nuclear Quantum Effects on Autoionization of Water Isotopologues Studied by Ab Initio Path Integral Molecular Dynamics	Bo Thomsen Motoyuki Shiga	Japan Atomic Energy Agency 178-4-4 Wakashiba Kashiwa Chiba 277-0871 Japan	thomsen.bo@jaea.go.jp shiga.motoyuki@jaea.go.jp	In this study we investigate the nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) on the acidity constant (p) of liquid water isotopologues at the ambient condition by path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations. We compared simulations using a fully explicit solvent model with a classical polarizable force field, density functional tight binding, and ab initio density functional theory, which correspond to empirical, semiempirical, and ab initio PIMD simulations, respectively. The centroid variable with respect to the proton coordination number of a water molecule was restrained to compute the gradient of the free energy, which measures the reversible work of the proton abstraction for the quantum mechanical system. The free energy curve obtained by thermodynamic integration was used to compute the pvalue based on probabilistic determination. This technique not only reproduces the pvalue of liquid DO experimentally measured (14.86) but also allows for a theoretical prediction of the pvalues of liquid TO, aqueous HDO and HTO which are unknown due to its scarcity. It is also shown that the NQEs on the free energy curve can result in a downshift ofpunits in the case of liquid water, which indicates that the NQEs plays an indispensable role in the absolute determination of p. The results of this study can help to inform further extensions into the calculation of the acidity constants of isotope substituted species with high accuracy.

Thomas Chaffre Julien Moras Adrien Chan-Hon-Tong Julien Marzat Karl Sammut Gilles Le Chenadec Benoit Clement	institutetext:		Navigation problems under unknown varying conditions are among the most important and well-studied problems in the control field. Classic model-based adaptive control methods can be applied only when a convenient model of the plant or environment is provided. Recent model-free adaptive control methods aim at removing this dependency by learning the physical characteristics of the plant and/or process directly from sensor feedback. Although there have been prior attempts at improving these techniques, it remains an open question as to whether it is possible to cope with real-world uncertainties in a control system that is fully based on either paradigm. We propose a conceptually simple learning-based approach composed of a full state feedback controller, tuned robustly by a deep reinforcement learning framework based on the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm. We compare it, in realistic simulations, to a model-free controller that uses the same deep reinforcement learning framework for the control of a micro aerial vehicle under wind gust. The results indicate the great potential of learning-based adaptive control methods in modern dynamical systems.

Bergin	Department of Astronomy University of Michigan 323 West Hall 1085 S. University Avenue Ann Arbor MI 48109 USA		Here we aim to explore the origin of the strong\ceC2H lines to reimagine the chemistry of protoplanetary disks. There are a few key aspects that drive our analysis. First,\ceC2H is detected in young and old systems, hinting at a long-lived chemistry. Second, as a radical,\ceC2H is rapidly destroyed, within1000 yr. These two statements hint that the chemistry responsible for\ceC2H emission must be predominantly in the gas-phase and must be in equilibrium. Combining new and published chemical models we find that elevating the total volatile (gas and ice) C/O ratio is the only natural way to create a long lived, high\ceC2H abundance. Most of the\ceC2H resides in gas with a. To elevate the volatile C/O ratio, additional carbon has to be released into the gas to enable an equilibrium chemistry under oxygen-poor conditions. Photo-ablation of carbon-rich grains seems the most straightforward way to elevate the C/O ratio above 1.5, powering a long-lived equilibrium cycle. The regions at which the conditions are optimal for the presence of high C/O ratio and elevated\ceC2H abundances in the gas disk set by thecondition lie just outside the pebble disk as well as possibly in disk gaps. This process can thus also explain the (hints of) structure seen in\ceC2H observations.	Protoplanetary disks | Astrochemistry | Chemical abundances

In this work, we show how even simpler networks can be produced by aggregating the nodes of the graphical model. We develop a new convex regularized method, called thetree-aggregated graphical lassoor tag-lasso, that estimates graphical models that are both edge-sparse and node-aggregated. The aggregation is performed in a data-driven fashion by leveraging side information in the form of a tree that encodes node similarity and facilitates the interpretation of the resulting aggregated nodes. We provide an efficient implementation of the tag-lasso by using the locally adaptive alternating direction method of multipliers and illustrate our proposal’s practical advantages in simulation and in applications in finance and biology.

It is laborious, and can be susceptible to interobserver variation. Prior studies have attempted to automate this process, but few have demonstrated an integrated suite of algorithms for the end-to-end analysis of angiograms. We report an automated analysis pipeline based on deep learning to rapidly and objectively assess coronary angiograms, highlight coronary vessels of interest, and quantify potential stenosis. We propose a 3-stage automated analysis method consisting of key frame extraction, vessel segmentation, and stenosis measurement. We combined powerful deep learning approaches such as ResNet and U-Net with traditional image processing and geometrical analysis. We trained and tested our algorithms on the Left Anterior Oblique (LAO) view of the right coronary artery (RCA) using anonymized angiograms obtained from a tertiary cardiac institution, then tested the generalizability of our technique to the Right Anterior Oblique (RAO) view. We demonstrated an overall improvement on previous work, with key frame extraction top-5 precision of 98.4%, vessel segmentation F1-Score of 0.891 and stenosis measurement 20.7% Type I Error rate.

This problem has been studied extensively when users’ preferences do not change over time (static case); an assumption that is often violated in practical settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for online non-stationary recommendation systems which allows for temporal uncertainties in the users’ preferences. For this model, we propose a user-based CF algorithm, and provide a theoretical analysis of its achievable reward. Compared to related non-stationary multi-armed bandit literature, the main fundamental difficulty in our model lies in the fact that variations in the preferences of a certain user may affect the recommendations for other users severely. We also test our algorithm over real-world datasets, showing its effectiveness in real-world applications. One of the main surprising observations in our experiments is the fact our algorithm outperforms other static algorithms even when preferences do not change over time. This hints toward the general conclusion that in practice, dynamic algorithms, such as the one we propose, might be beneficial even in stationary environments.

These AIF models therefore have two reset conditions, which enable bursting dynamics to emerge for suitable parameter values. Such models can be thought of as hybrid dynamical systems. We consider a particular slow dynamics within AIF models and prove the existence of bursting cycles withresets, for any integer. Furthermore, we study the transition between- and-reset cycles upon vanishingly small parameter variations and prove (for) that such transitions are organised by canard cycles. Finally, using numerical continuation we compute branches of bursting cycles, including canard-explosive branches, in these AIF models, by suitably recasting the periodic problem as a two-point boundary-value problem.	
[2101.12508] Connecting gravity field, moment of inertia, and core properties in Jupiter through empirical structure models	Benno A. Neuenschwander Ravit Helled Naor Movshovitz Jonathan J. Fortney	Center for Theoretical Astrophysics and Cosmology Institute for Computational Science University of ZurichWinterthurerstrasse 190 CH-8057 Zürich Switzerland		Constraining Jupiter’s internal structure is crucial for understanding its formation and evolution history. Recent interior models of Jupiter that fit Juno’s measured gravitational field suggest an inhomogeneous interior and potentially the existence of a diluted core. These models, however, strongly depend on the model assumptions and the equations of state used. A complementary modelling approach is to use empirical structure models. These can later be used to reveal new insights on the planetary interior and be compared to standard models. Here we present empirical structure models of Jupiter where the density profile is constructed by piecewise-polytropic equations. With these models we investigate the relation between the normalized moment of inertia (MoI) and the gravitational momentsand. Given that only the first few gravitational moments of Jupiter are measured with high precision, we show that an accurate and independent measurement of the MoI value could be used to further constrain Jupiter’s interior. An independent measurement of the MoI with an accuracy better thancould constrain Jupiter’s core region and density discontinuities in its envelope. We find that models with a density discontinuity at1 Mbar, as would produce a presumed hydrogen-helium separation, correspond to a fuzzy core in Jupiter. We next test the appropriateness of using polytropes, by comparing them with empirical models based on polynomials. We conclude that both representations result in similar density profiles and ranges of values for quantities like core mass and MoI.	planets and satellites: interiors; planets and satellites: gaseous planets; planets and satellites: composition
[2101.12509] Challenges for Using Impact Regularizers to Avoid Negative Side Effects	David Lindner,1Kyle Matoba,211footnotemark:1Alexander Meulemans311footnotemark:1	footnotemark:		Designing reward functions for reinforcement learning is difficult: besides specifying which behavior is rewarded for a task, the reward also has to discourage undesired outcomes. Misspecified reward functions can lead to unintended negative side effects, and overall unsafe behavior. To overcome this problem, recent work proposed to augment the specified reward function with an impact regularizer that discourages behavior that has a big impact on the environment. Although initial results with impact regularizers seem promising in mitigating some types of side effects, important challenges remain. In this paper, we examine the main current challenges of impact regularizers and relate them to fundamental design decisions. We discuss in detail which challenges recent approaches address and which remain unsolved. Finally, we explore promising directions to overcome the unsolved challenges in preventing negative side effects with impact regularizers.

Animated transitions are used to facilitate understanding of graphical transformations between different visualizations. Area is a key information to preserve during filtering or ordering transitions of area-based charts like bar charts, histograms, tree maps or mosaic plots. As liquids are incompressible fluids, we use a hydraulic metaphor to convey the sense of area preservation during animated transitions: inaquanims, graphical objects can change shape, position, color and even connectedness but not displayed area, as for a liquid contained in a transparent vessel or transferred between such vessels communicating through hidden pipes. We present variousaquanimsfor product plots like bar charts and histograms to accomodate changes in data, in ordering of bars or in number of bins, and to provide animated tips. We also consider confusion matrices visualized as fluctuation diagrams and mosaic plots, and show howaquanimscan be used to ease the understanding of different classification errors of real data."	:\CCScat
[2101.12512] A Model of WiFi Performance With Bounded Latency	Bjørn Ivar Teigen Neil Davies Kai Olav Ellefsen Tor Skeie Jim Torresen	University of	neil.davies@pnsol.com jimtoer@ifi.uio.no tskeie@ifi.uio.no kaiolae@ifi.uio.no bjornite@ifi.uio.no	In September 2020, the Broadband Forum published a new industry standard for measuring network quality. The standard centers on the notion of quality attenuation. Quality attenuation is a measure of the distribution of latency and packet loss between two points connected by a network path. A vital feature of the quality attenuation idea is that we can express detailed application requirements and network performance measurements in the same mathematical framework. Performance requirements and measurements are both modeled as latency distributions. To the best of our knowledge, existing models of the 802.11 WiFi protocol do not permit the calculation of complete latency distributions without assuming steady-state operation. We present a novel model of the WiFi protocol. Instead of computing throughput numbers from a steady-state analysis of a Markov chain, we explicitly model latency and packet loss. Explicitly modeling latency and loss allows for both transient and steady-state analysis of latency distributions, and we can derive throughput numbers from the latency results. Our model is, therefore, more general than the standard Markov chain methods. We reproduce several known results with this method. Using transient analysis, we derive bounds on WiFi throughput under the requirement that latency and packet loss must be bounded.

By using probabilistic approaches extensively, we establish two-sided Dirichlet heat estimates of such processes for all time. The estimates are very sensitive with respect to the reference function corresponding to each horn-shaped region. Our results also cover the case that the associated Dirichlet semigroup is not intrinsically ultracontractive. A striking observation from our estimates is that, even when the associated Dirichlet semigroup is intrinsically ultracontractive, the so-called Varopoulos-type estimates do not hold for symmetric stable processes on horn-shaped regions.

California Blvd. Pasadena CA 91125 	ortiz@caltech.edu	We compare the accuracy, convergence rate and computational cost of eigenerosion (EE) and phase-field (PF) methods. For purposes of comparison, we specifically consider the standard test case of a center-crack panel loaded in biaxial tension and assess the convergence of the energy error as the length scale parameter and mesh size tend to zero simultaneously. The panel is discretized by means of a regular mesh consisting of standard bilinear or1 elements. The exact stresses from the known analytical linear elastic solution are applied to the boundary. All element integrals over the interior and the boundary of the domain are evaluated exactly using the symbolic computation program Mathematica. When the EE inelastic energy is enhanced by means of Richardson extrapolation, EE is found to converge at twice the rate of PF and to exhibit much better accuracy. In addition, EE affords a one-order-of-magnitude computational speed-up over PF.

However, these models trained on the source domain always suffer dramatic performance drop when tested on an unseen domain. Existing methods are primary to use pseudo labels to alleviate this problem. One of the most successful approaches predicts neighbors of each unlabeled image and then uses them to train the model. Although the predicted neighbors are credible, they always miss some hard positive samples, which may hinder the model from discovering important discriminative information of the unlabeled domain. In this paper, to complement these low recall neighbor pseudo labels, we propose a joint learning framework to learn better feature embeddings via high precision neighbor pseudo labels and high recall group pseudo labels. The group pseudo labels are generated by transitively merging neighbors of different samples into a group to achieve higher recall. However, the merging operation may cause subgroups in the group due to imperfect neighbor predictions. To utilize these group pseudo labels properly, we propose using a similarity-aggregating loss to mitigate the influence of these subgroups by pulling the input sample towards the most similar embeddings. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance under the unsupervised domain adaptation re-ID setting.

We study the relationship between properties of the local mechanisms, each responsible for assigning all of the resources of a designated type, and the properties of asequential mechanismwhich is composed of these local mechanisms, one for each type, applied sequentially, underlexicographic preferences, a well studied model of preferences over multiple types of resources in artificial intelligence and economics. We show that when preferences are-legal, meaning that agents share a common importance order on the types, sequential mechanisms satisfy the desirable properties of anonymity, neutrality, non-bossiness, or Pareto-optimality if and only if every local mechanism also satisfies the same property, and they are applied sequentially according to the order. Our main results are that under-legal lexicographic preferences, every mechanism satisfying strategyproofness and a combination of these properties must be a sequential composition of local mechanisms that are also strategyproof, and satisfy the same combinations of properties.	
[2101.12523] Optimal strategies for reject option classifiers	\nameVojtech    of Cybernetics, Faculty of Electrical EngineeringCzech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic		voracva1@fel.cvut.cz prusa@fel.cvut.cz xfrancv@fel.cvut.cz	In classification with a reject option, the classifier is allowed in uncertain cases to abstain from prediction. The classical cost-based model of a reject option classifier requires the cost of rejection to be defined explicitly. An alternative bounded-improvement model, avoiding the notion of the reject cost, seeks for a classifier with a guaranteed selective risk and maximal cover. We coin a symmetric definition, the bounded-coverage model, which seeks for a classifier with minimal selective risk and guaranteed coverage. We prove that despite their different formulations the three rejection models lead to the same prediction strategy: a Bayes classifier endowed with a randomized Bayes selection function. We define a notion of a proper uncertainty score as a scalar summary of prediction uncertainty sufficient to construct the randomized Bayes selection function. We propose two algorithms to learn the proper uncertainty score from examples for an arbitrary black-box classifier. We prove that both algorithms provide Fisher consistent estimates of the proper uncertainty score and we demonstrate their efficiency on different prediction problems including classification, ordinal regression and structured output classification.

[2101.12525] Regularizing Double Machine Learning in Partially Linear Endogenous Models	Corinne Emmenegger and Peter BühlmannSeminar for Statistics, ETH Zürich			The linear coefficient in a partially linear model with confounding variables can be estimated using double machine learning (DML). However, this DML estimator has a two-stage least squares (TSLS) interpretation and may produce overly wide confidence intervals. To address this issue, we propose a regularization and selection scheme,\nohyphensregsDML, which leads to narrower confidence intervals. It selects either the TSLS DML estimator or a regularization-only estimator depending on whose estimated variance is smaller. The regularization-only estimator is tailored to have a low mean squared error. The\nohyphensregsDML estimator is fully data driven. The\nohyphensregsDML estimator converges at the parametric rate, is asymptotically Gaussian distributed, and asymptotically equivalent to the TSLS DML estimator, but\nohyphensregsDML exhibits substantially better finite sample properties. The\nohyphensregsDML estimator uses the idea of k-class estimators, and we show how DML and k-class estimation can be combined to estimate the linear coefficient in a partially linear endogenous model. Empirical examples demonstrate our methodological and theoretical developments. Software code for our\nohyphensregsDML method is available in theR-packagedmlalg.	
[2101.12526] The Behavioral Economics of Intrapersonal Conflict: A Critical Assessment	Sebastian Krügel Matthias Uhl	Technical University of Munich Richard-Wagner-Strasse 1 D-80333 Munich Germany phone: +49 89 907793 280 e-mail:	m.uhl@tum.de sebastian.kruegel@tum.de	Preferences often change—even in short time intervals—due to either the mere passage of time (present-biased preferences) or changes in environmental conditions (state-dependent preferences). On the basis of the empirical findings in the context of state-dependent preferences, we critically discuss the Aristotelian view of unitary decision makers in economics and urge a more Heraclitean perspective on human decision-making. We illustrate that the conceptualization of preferences as present-biased or state-dependent has very different normative implications under the Aristotelian view, although both concepts are empirically hard to distinguish. This is highly problematic, as it renders almost any paternalistic intervention justifiable.	Intrapersonal conflict; State-dependent preferences; Projection bias; Paternalism
[2101.12527] 1 Introduction				Search for new phenomena in final states with-jets and missing transverse momentum incollisions with the ATLAS detector\AtlasJournalJHEP\AtlasAbstractThe results of a search for new phenomena in final states with-jets and missing transverse momentum using 139 fbof proton–proton data collected at a centre-of-mass energyTeV by the ATLAS detector at the LHC are reported. The analysis targets final states produced by the decay of a pair-produced supersymmetric bottom squark into a bottom quark and a stable neutralino. The analysis also seeks evidence for models of pair production of dark matter particles produced through the decay of a generic scalar or pseudoscalar mediator state in association with a pair of bottom quarks, and models of pair production of scalar third-generation down-type leptoquarks. No significant excess of events over the Standard Model background expectation is observed in any of the signal regions considered by the analysis. Bottom squark masses beloware excluded at 95% confidence level if the neutralino is massless. In the case of nearly mass-degenerate bottom squarks and neutralinos, the use of dedicated secondary-vertex identification techniques permits the exclusion of bottom squarks with masses up tofor mass splittings between the squark and the neutralino of. These limits extend substantially beyond the regions of parameter space excluded by similar ATLAS searches performed previously.\AtlasRefCodeSUSY-2018-34\PreprintIdNumberCERN-EP-2021-001\AtlasJournalRefJHEP 05 (2021) 093\AtlasDOI10.1007/JHEP05(2021)093

[2101.12529] Phases of Holographic Interfaces	Constantin Bachas and Vassilis Papadopoulos			We compute the phase diagram of the simplest holographic bottom-up model of conformal interfaces. The model consists of a thin domain wall between three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacua, anchored on a boundary circle. We distinguish five phases depending on the existence of a black hole, the intersection of its horizon with the wall, and the fate of inertial observers. We show that, like the Hawking-Page phase transition, the capture of the wall by the horizon is also a first order transition and comment on its field-theory interpretation. The static solutions of the domain-wall equations include gravitational avatars of the Faraday cage, black holes with negative specific heat, and an intriguing phenomenon of suspended vacuum bubbles corresponding to an exotic interface/anti-interface fusion. Part of our analysis overlaps with recent work by Simidzija and Van Raamsdonk but the interpretation is different.

We employ the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) as a performance metric of target estimation, under both point and extended target scenarios. We then propose minimizing the CRB of radar sensing while guaranteeing a pre-defined level of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for each communication user. For the single-user scenario, we derive a closed form for the optimal solution for both cases of point and extended targets. For the multi-user scenario, we show that both problems can be relaxed into semidefinite programming by using the semidefinite relaxation approach, and prove that the global optimum can always be obtained. Finally, we demonstrate numerically that the globally optimal solutions are reachable via the proposed methods, which provide significant gains in target estimation performance over state-of-the-art benchmarks.

[2101.12531] Kondo screening regimes in multi-Dirac and Weyl systems	G. T. D. Pedrosa Joelson F. Silva E. Vernek	Instituto de Física Universidade Federal de Uberlândia Uberlândia Minas Gerais 38400-902 Brazil.		We have investigated the Kondo physics of a single magnetic impurity embedded in multi-Dirac (Weyl) node fermionic systems. By using a generic effective model for the host material and employing a numerical renormalization group approach we access the low temperature behavior of the system, identifying the existence of Kondo screening in single-, double-, and triple-Dirac (Weyl) node models. We find that in any multi-Dirac node systems the low-energy regime lies within one of the known classes of pseudogap Kondo problem, extensively studied in the literature. Kondo screening is also observed for time reversal symmetry broken Weyl systems. This is, however, possible only in the particle-hole symmetry broken regime obtained for finite chemical potential. Although weakly, breaking time-reversal symmetry suppresses the Kondo resonance, especially in the single-node Weyl semimetals. More interesting Kondo screening regimes are obtained for inversion symmetry broken multi-Weyl fermions. In these systems the Kondo regimes of double- and triple-Weyl node models are much richer than in the single-Weyl node model. While in the single-Weyl node model the Kondo temperature increases monotonically withregardless the value of the inversion symmetry breaking parameter, in double- and triple-Weyl node models there are two distinct regimes: (i) Forthe Kondo temperature depends strongly on, while (ii) forthe Kondo temperature depends very weakly on, resembling the flat-band single impurity Anderson model.

In order to explain these challenging events very specific assumptions are required and we argue that such scenarios are order of magnitude more probable in mirror world, where star formation begins earlier and matter density can exceed 5 times the ordinary matter density.

The model incorporates radar scattering phenomenology of commonly found vehicles along with range-Doppler based clutter and receiver noise. These images provide insights into the physical dimensions of the target, the number of wheels and the trajectory undertaken by the target. The model is experimentally validated with measurement data gathered from an automotive radar. The images from the simulation database are subsequently classified using both traditional machine learning techniques as well as deep neural networks based on transfer learning. We show that the ISAR images offer a classification accuracy above 90% and are robust to both noise and clutter.	ISAR | classification | automotive radar | transfer learning | radar database

In an effective-Lagrangian approach, we explore in particular the effect of the operator, which describes the interaction of the Higgs boson with transverse vector-boson polarization modes. By tagging highly boosted Higgs bosons in the final state, we determine projected bounds for the coefficient of this operator at the LHC and at a future 27 TeV or 100 TeV collider. Taking into account unitarity constraints, we estimate the new-physics discovery potential of Higgs pair production in this channel.

We focus on a holographic model which has the same global symmetry as that of low energy plasma and obtain the lifetime of (non-conserved) electric flux in a strong magnetic field regime. The lifetime is inversely correlated to the magnetic field strength and thus suppressed in the strong field regime.

[2101.12542] On some efficiency conditions for vector optimization problems with uncertain cone constraints: a robust approach	\nameA. Uderzoa	CONTACT A. Uderzo. Email: di Matematica e Applicazioni Università di Milano-Bicocca Milano Italy	amos.uderzo@unimib.it	In the present paper, several types of efficiency conditions are established for vector optimization problems with cone constraints affected by uncertainty, but with no information of stochastic nature about the uncertain data. Following a robust optimization approach, data uncertainty is faced by handling set-valued inclusion problems. The employment of recent results about error bounds and tangential approximations of the solution set to the latter enables one to achieve necessary conditions for weak efficiency via a penalization method as well as via the modern revisitation of the Euler-Lagrange method, with or without generalized convexity assumptions. The presented conditions are formulated in terms of various nonsmooth analysis constructions, expressing first-order approximations of mappings and sets, while the metric increase property plays the role of a constraint qualification.

In this work, we consider the problem of few-shot object detection (FSOD) in a real-world, class-imbalanced scenario. For our experiments, we utilize the India Driving Dataset (IDD), as it includes a class of less-occurring road objects in the image dataset and hence provides a setup suitable for few-shot learning. We evaluate both metric-learning and meta-learning based FSOD methods, in two experimental settings: (i) representative (same-domain) splits from IDD, that evaluates the ability of a model to learn in the context of road images, and (ii) object classes with less-occurring object samples, similar to the open-set setting in real-world. From our experiments, we demonstrate that the metric-learning method outperforms meta-learning on the novel classes by (i) 11.2points on the same domain, and (ii) 1.0point on the open-set. We also show that our extension of object classes in a real-world open dataset offers a rich ground for few-shot learning studies.	
[2101.12544] Dynamically stable negative-energy states induced by spin-transfer torques	J. S. Harms A. Rückriegel R. A. Duine	for Theoretical Physics Utrecht University 3584CC Utrecht The Netherlands	j.s.harms@uu.nl	We investigate instabilities of the magnetic ground state in ferromagnetic metals that are induced by uniform electrical currents, and, in particular, go beyond previous analyses by including dipolar interactions. These instabilities arise from spin-transfer torques that lead to Doppler shifted spin waves. For sufficiently large electrical currents, spin-wave excitations have negative energy with respect to the uniform magnetic ground state, while remaining dynamically stable due to dissipative spin-transfer torques. Hence, the uniform magnetic ground state is energetically unstable, but is not able to dynamically reach the new ground state. We estimate this to happen for current densitiesin typical thin film experiments, withthe Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction constant, andthe Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that is required for spontaneous formation of spirals or skyrmions. These current densities can be made arbitrarily small for ultrathin film thicknesses at the order of nanometers, due to surface- and interlayer effects. From an analogue gravity perspective, the stable negative energy states are an essential ingredient to implement event horizons for magnons – the quanta of spin waves – giving rise to e.g. Hawking radiation and can be used to significantly amplify spin waves in a so-called black-hole laser.

Quadrotors can achieve aggressive flight by tracking complex maneuvers and rapidly changing directions. Planning for aggressive flight with trajectory optimization could be incredibly fast, even in higher dimensions, and can account for dynamics of the quadrotor, however, only provides a locally optimal solution. On the other hand, planning with discrete graph search can handle non-convex spaces to guarantee optimality but suffers from exponential complexity with the dimension of search. We introduce a framework for aggressive quadrotor trajectory generation with global reasoning capabilities that combines the best of trajectory optimization and discrete graph search. Specifically, we develop a novel algorithmic framework thatinterleavesthese two methods to complement each other and generate trajectories with provable guarantees on completeness up to discretization. We demonstrate and quantitatively analyze the performance of our algorithm in challenging simulation environments with narrow gaps that create severe attitude constraints and push the dynamic capabilities of the quadrotor. Experiments show the benefits of the proposed algorithmic framework over standalone trajectory optimization and graph search-based planning techniques for aggressive quadrotor flight.

As user-item interactions can be naturally modelled as graph-structured data, variants of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have become a well-established building block in the latest recommenders. Due to the wide utilization of sensitive user profile data, existing recommendation paradigms are likely to expose users to the threat of privacy breach, and GCN-based recommenders are no exception. Apart from the leakage of raw user data, the fragility of current recommenders under inference attacks offers malicious attackers a backdoor to estimate users’ private attributes via their behavioral footprints and the recommendation results. However, little attention has been paid to developing recommender systems that can defend such attribute inference attacks, and existing works achieve attack resistance by either sacrificing considerable recommendation accuracy or only covering specific attack models or protected information. In our paper, we propose GERAI, a novel differentially private graph convolutional network to address such limitations. Specifically, in GERAI, we bind the information perturbation mechanism in differential privacy with the recommendation capability of graph convolutional networks. Furthermore, based on local differential privacy and functional mechanism, we innovatively devise a dual-stage encryption paradigm to simultaneously enforce privacy guarantee on users’ sensitive features and the model optimization process. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GERAI in terms of its resistance to attribute inference attacks and recommendation effectiveness.

Such high magnitude solar flare event can interfere space-earth radio communications and neutralize space-earth electronics equipment. In the current study, we explorer the deep learning approach to build a solar flare forecasting model and examine its limitations along with the ability of features extraction, based on the available time-series data. For that purpose, we present a multi-layer 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to forecast solar flare events probability occurrence of M and X classes at 1,3,6,12,24,48,72,96 hours time frame. In order to train and evaluate the performance of the model, we utilised the available Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) X-ray time series data, ranged between July 1998 and January 2019, covering almost entirely the solar cycles 23 and 24. The forecasting model were trained and evaluated in two different scenarios (1) random selection and (2) chronological selection, which were compare afterward. Moreover we compare our results to those considered as state-of-the-art flare forecasting models, both with similar approaches and different ones.The majority of the results indicates that (1) chronological selection obtain a degradation factor of 3% versus the random selection for the M class model and elevation factor of 2% for the X class model. (2) When consider utilizing only X-ray time-series data, the suggested model achieve high score results compare to other studies.

The result is a non-perturbative theory of quantum mechanics on (pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds. Within this approach, we derive stochastic differential equations for massive spin-0 test particles charged under scalar potentials, vector potentials and gravity. Furthermore, we derive the associated Schrödinger equation. The resulting equations show that massive scalar particles must be conformally coupled to gravity in a theory of quantum gravity. We conclude with a discussion of some prospects of the stochastic framework.

This work was done when Haoran Xin was an intern at the Baidu Research.		Out-of-town recommendation is designed for those users who leave their home-town areas and visit the areas they have never been to before. It is challenging to recommend Point-of-Interests (POIs) for out-of-town users since the out-of-town check-in behavior is determined by not only the user’s home-town preference but also the user’s travel intention. Besides, the user’s travel intentions are complex and dynamic, which leads to big difficulties in understanding such intentions precisely. In this paper, we propose aTravel-intention-awareOut-of-townRecommendation framework, namedTrainOR. The proposedTrainORframework distinguishes itself from existing out-of-town recommenders in three aspects. First, graph neural networks are explored to represent users’ home-town check-in preference and geographical constraints in out-of-town check-in behaviors. Second, a user-specific travel intention is formulated as an aggregation combining home-town preference and generic travel intention together, where the generic travel intention is regarded as a mixture of inherent intentions that can be learned by Neural Topic Model (NTM). Third, a non-linear mapping function, as well as a matrix factorization method, are employed to transfer users’ home-town preference and estimate out-of-town POI’s representation, respectively. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets validate the effectiveness of theTrainORframework. Moreover, the learned travel intention can deliver meaningful explanations for understanding a user’s travel purposes.	
[2101.12556] Emergence of universality in the transmission dynamics of COVID-19	Ayan Paul Jayanta Kumar Bhattacharjee Akshay Pal Sagar Chakraborty	Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY Notkestr. 85 22607 Hamburg GermanyInstitut für Physik Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin D-12489 Berlin GermanyCorresponding author		The complexities involved in modelling the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 has been a roadblock in achieving predictability in the spread and containment of the disease. In addition to understanding the modes of transmission, the effectiveness of the mitigation methods also needs to be built into any effective model for making such predictions. We show that such complexities can be circumvented by appealing to scaling principles which lead to the emergence of universality in the transmission dynamics of the disease. The ensuing data collapse renders the transmission dynamics largely independent of geopolitical variations, the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, population demographics, etc. We propose a simple two-parameter model—the Blue Sky model—and show that one class of transmission dynamics can be explained by a solution that lives at the edge of a blue sky bifurcation. In addition, the data collapse leads to an enhanced degree of predictability in the disease spread for several geographical scales which can also be realized in a model-independent manner as we show using a deep neural network. The methodology adopted in this work can potentially be applied to the transmission of other infectious diseases and new universality classes may be found. The predictability in transmission dynamics and the simplicity of our methodology can help in building policies for exit strategies and mitigation methods during a pandemic.

Miheev Institute of Metal Physics Russian Academy of Sciences 620108 Yekaterinburg RussiaUral Federal University 620002 Yekaterinburg RussiaSkolkovo Institute of Science and Technology 143026 Moscow Russia		We explore the interplay of electron-electron correlations and surface effects in the prototypical correlated insulating material, NiO. In particular, we compute the electronic structure, magnetic properties, and surface energies of theandsurfaces of paramagnetic NiO using a fully charge self-consistent DFT+dynamical mean-field theory method. Our results reveal a complex interplay between electronic correlations and surface effects in NiO, with the electronic structure of theandNiO surfaces being significantly different from that in bulk NiO. We obtain a sizeable reduction of the band gap at the surface of NiO, which is most significant for theNiO surface. This suggests a higher catalytic activity of theNiO surface than that of theNiO one. Our results reveal a charge-transfer character of theandsurfaces of NiO. Most notably, for theNiO surface we observe a remarkable electronic state characterized by an alternating charge-transfer and Mott-Hubbard character of the band gap in the surface and subsurface NiO layers, respectively. This novel form of electronic order stabilized by strong correlations is not driven by lattice reconstructions but of purely electronic origin. We notice the importance of orbital-differentiation of the Nistates to characterize the Mott-Hubbard insulating state of theandNiO surfaces. The unoccupied Nisurface states are seen to split from the lower edge of the conduction band to form strongly localized states in the fundamental gap of bulk NiO. Our results for the surface energies of theandNiO surfaces show that thefacet of NiO has significantly lower energy. This implies that the relative stability of different surfaces, at least from a purely energetic point of view, does not depend on the presence or absence of magnetic order in NiO.	
[2101.12559] Mining the Mind: Linear Discriminant Analysis of MEG source reconstruction time series supports dynamic changes in deep brain regions during meditation sessions	D Calvetti B Johnson A Pascarella F Pitolli E Somersalo B Vantaggi			Meditation practices have been claimed to have a positive effect on the regulation of mood and emotion for quite some time by practitioners, and in recent times there has been a sustained effort to provide a more precise description of the changes induced by meditation on human brain. Longitudinal studies have reported morphological changes in cortical thickness and volume in selected brain regions due to meditation practice, which is interpreted as evidence for effectiveness of it beyond the subjective self reporting. Evidence based on real time monitoring of meditating brain by functional imaging modalities such as MEG or EEG remains a challenge. In this article we consider MEG data collected during meditation sessions of experienced Buddhist monks practicing focused attention (Samatha) and open monitoring (Vipassana) meditation, contrasted by resting state with eyes closed. The MEG data is first mapped to time series of brain activity averaged over brain regions corresponding to a standard Destrieux brain atlas, and further by bootstrapping and spectral analysis to data matrices representing a random sample of power spectral densities over bandwidths corresponding to,,, andbands in the spectral range. We demonstrate using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) that the samples corresponding to different meditative or resting states contain enough fingerprints of the brain state to allow a separation between different states, and we identify the brain regions that appear to contribute to the separation. Our findings suggest that cingulate cortex, insular cortex and some of the internal structures, most notably accumbens, caudate and putamen nuclei, thalamus and amygdalae stand out as separating regions, which seems to correlate well with earlier findings based on longitudinal studies.Keywords: MEG inverse problem, Activity map, Meditation, Spectral analysis, Linear discriminant analysis, Deep sources	Keywords

The introduction of obstacles or the placement of additional robots in the workspace, the modification of the joint range due to faults or range-of-motion constraints are typical cases where the adaptation capabilities play a key role for safely performing the robot’s task. Probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs) have been proposed for representing adaptable movement skills, which are modelled as Gaussian distributions over trajectories. These are analytically tractable and can be learned from a small number of demonstrations. However, both the original ProMP formulation and the subsequent approaches only provide solutions to specific movement adaptation problems, e.g., obstacle avoidance, and a generic, unifying, probabilistic approach to adaptation is missing. In this paper we develop a generic probabilistic framework for adapting ProMPs. We unify previous adaptation techniques, for example, various types of obstacle avoidance, via-points, mutual avoidance, in one single framework and combine them to solve complex robotic problems. Additionally, we derive novel adaptation techniques such as temporally unbound via-points and mutual avoidance. We formulate adaptation as a constrained optimisation problem where we minimise the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the adapted distribution and the distribution of the original primitive while we constrain the probability mass associated with undesired trajectories to be low. We demonstrate our approach on several adaptation problems on simulated planar robot arms and 7-DOF Franka-Emika robots in a dual robot arm setting.

Moreover, when the SDE is order-preserving, the exponential ergodicity is derived in the Wasserstein distance induced by one-dimensional increasing functions chosen according to the coefficients of the equation.

The optimal bottleneck trade-off between relevance (measured via Shannon’s mutual information) and Rényi entropy cost is defined and an iterative algorithm for finding approximate solutions is provided. We also derive an operational characterization for the optimal trade-off by demonstrating that the optimal Rényi entropy-relevance trade-off is achievable by a simple time-sharing scalar coding scheme and that no coding scheme can provide better performance. Two examples where the optimal Shannon entropy-relevance trade-off can be exactly determined are further given.

In this context, dynamical low-rank approximations have emerged as a promising way to reduce the high computational cost imposed by such problems. However, a major disadvantage of this approach is that the physical structure of the underlying problem is not preserved. In this paper, we propose a dynamical low-rank algorithm that conserves mass, momentum, and energy as well as the corresponding continuity equations. We also show how this approach can be combined with a conservative time and space discretization.	dynamical low-rank approximation | conservative numerical methods | complexity reduction | Vlasov equation | kinetic equation

[2101.12578] Adjusting for Autocorrelated Errors in Neural Networks for Time Series	Fan-Keng SunDepartment of EECS,  I. LangDepartment of EECS,  S. BoningDepartment of EECS,		fankeng@mit.edu boning@mtl.mit.edu langc@mit.edu	An increasing body of research focuses on using neural networks to model time series. A common assumption in training neural networks via maximum likelihood estimation on time series is that the errors across time steps are uncorrelated. However, errors are actually autocorrelated in many cases due to the temporality of the data, which makes such maximum likelihood estimations inaccurate. In this paper, in order to adjust for autocorrelated errors, we propose to learn the autocorrelation coefficient jointly with the model parameters. In our experiments, we verify the effectiveness of our approach on time series forecasting. Results across a wide range of real-world datasets with various state-of-the-art models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases. Based on these results, we suggest empirical critical values to determine the severity of autocorrelated errors. We also analyze several aspects of our method to demonstrate its advantages. Finally, other time series tasks are also considered to validate that our method is not restricted to only forecasting.

In many buildings periodic disinfection is performed manually; this has several disadvantages: it is expensive, limited in the number of times it can be done over a day, and poses an increased risk to the workers performing the task. To solve these problems, we developed an automated decontamination system that uses ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation for disinfection, coupled with occupancy detection for its safe operation. UVC irradiation is a well-established technology for the deactivation of a wide range of pathogens. Our proposed system can deactivate pathogens both on surfaces and in the air. The coupling with occupancy detection ensures that occupants are never directly exposed to UVC lights and their potential harmful effects. To help the wider community, we have shared our complete work as an open-source repository, to be used under GPL v3.

This problem becomes even more critical with regards to complex dynamical systems like weather forecasting and econometric models, which can show highly non-linear behaviour. A method based on mutual information and deep neural networks is proposed as a versatile framework for discovering non-linear relationships ranging from functional dependencies to causality. We demonstrate the application of this method to actual multivariable non-linear dynamical systems. We also show that this method can find relationships even for datasets with small number of datapoints, as is often the case with empirical data.

The integration rules obtained are of particular interest for the approximation of multivariate integrals in weighted Walsh spaces. In particular, we study a construction algorithm which assembles the components of the generating vector, which is in this case a vector of polynomials over a finite field, of the polynomial lattice rule in a component-wise fashion. We show that the constructed QMC rules achieve the almost optimal error convergence order in the function spaces under consideration and prove that the obtained error bounds can, under certain conditions on the involved weights, be made independent of the dimension. We also demonstrate that our alternative component-by-component construction, which is independent of the underlying smoothness of the function space, can be implemented relatively easily in a fast manner. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings.

Petta	Department of Physics Princeton University Princeton New Jersey 08544 USA		Electrons confined in silicon quantum dots exhibit orbital, spin, and valley degrees of freedom. The valley degree of freedom originates from the bulk bandstructure of silicon, which has six degenerate electronic minima. The degeneracy can be lifted in silicon quantum wells due to strain and electronic confinement, but the “valley splitting” of the two lowest lying valleys is known to be sensitive to atomic-scale disorder. Large valley splittings are desirable to have a well-defined spin qubit. In addition, an understanding of the inter-valley tunnel coupling that couples different valleys in adjacent quantum dots is extremely important, as the resulting gaps in the energy level diagram may affect the fidelity of charge and spin transfer protocols in silicon quantum dot arrays. Here we use microwave spectroscopy to probe spatial variations in the valley splitting, and the intra- and inter-valley tunnel couplings (and) that couple dotsandin a triple quantum dot (TQD). We uncover large spatial variations in the ratio of inter-valley to intra-valley tunnel couplingsand. By tuning the interdot tunnel barrier we also show thatscales linearly with, as expected from theory. The results indicate strong interactions between different valley states on neighboring dots, which we attribute to local inhomogeneities in the silicon quantum well.

Jónsson Tejs Vegge Hannes Jónsson		hj@hi.is alxvov@gmail.com	The energy minimization involved in density functional calculations of electronic systems can be carried out using an exponential transformation that preserves the orthonormality of the orbitals. The energy of the system is then represented as a function of the elements of a skew-Hermitian matrix that can be optimized directly using unconstrained minimization methods. An implementation based on the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno approach with inexact line search and a preconditioner is presented and the performance compared with that of the commonly used self-consistent field approach. Results are presented for the G2 set of 148 molecules, liquid water configurations with up to 576 molecules and some insulating crystals. A general preconditioner is presented that is applicable to systems with fractional orbital occupation as is, for example, needed in the k-point sampling for periodic systems. This exponential transformation direct minimization approach is found to outperform the standard implementation of the self-consistent field approach in that all the calculations converge with the same set of parameter values and it requires less computational effort on average. The formulation of the exponential transformation and the gradients of the energy presented here are quite general and can be applied to energy functionals that are not unitary invariant such as self-interaction corrected functionals.

Wabnitz	Department of Information Engineering Electronics and Telecommunications (DIET) Sapienza University of Rome Via Eudossiana 18 00184 Rome ItalyCorresponding author:	mario.zitelli@uniroma1.it	Experimental and numerical studies of spatiotemporal femtosecond soliton propagation over up to 1 km spans of parabolic graded-index (GRIN) fibers reveal that initial multimode soliton pulses naturally and irreversibly evolve into a singlemode soliton. This is carried by the fundamental mode of the fiber, which acts as a dynamical attractor of the multimode system for up to the record value (for multimode fibers) of 5600 chromatic dispersion distances. This experimental evidence invalidates the use of variational approaches, which intrinsically require that the initial multimode propagation of a self-imaging soliton is indefinitely maintained.

Email:	yp@mit.edu elisabetta.cornacchia@epfl.ch emmanuel.abbe@epfl.ch yuzhougu@mit.edu	The limit of the entropy in the stochastic block model (SBM) has been characterized in the sparse regime for the special case of disassortative communities[COKPZ17]and for the classical case of assortative communities but in the dense regime[DAM16]. The problem has not been closed in the classical sparse and assortative case. This paper establishes the result in this case for any SNR besides for the interval. It further gives an approximation to the limit in this window.

The joint guarantee of differential privacy (indistinguishability) and distortion privacy (inference error) limits the information leakage. In this paper, we analyze the differential privacy of PIVE, a dynamic location obfuscation mechanism proposed by Yu, Liu and Pu (NDSS 2017), and show that PIVE fails to offer either of the privacy guarantees on adaptive Protection Location Sets (PLSs) as claimed. Specifically, we demonstrate that different PLSs could intersect with one another due to the defined search algorithm, and then different apriori locations in the same PLS could have different protection diameters. As a result, we can show that the proof of local differential privacy for PIVE is problematic. Besides, the condition introduced in PIVE is confirmed to be not sufficient for bounding expected inference errors in general, which makes the user-defined inference error threshold invalid. To address these issues, we propose a couple of correction approaches, analyze theoretically their satisfied privacy characteristics and detail their respective merits and demerits.

[2101.12603] Finite-key analysis of loss-tolerant quantum key distribution based on random sampling theory	Guillermo Currás-Lorenzo Álvaro Navarrete Margarida Pereira Kiyoshi Tamaki	of Electronic and Electrical Engineering University of Leeds Leeds United Kingdom	g.j.curraslorenzo@leeds.ac.uk	The core of security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) is the estimation of a parameter that determines the amount of privacy amplification that the users need to apply in order to distill a secret key. To estimate this parameter using the observed data, one needs to apply concentration inequalities, such as random sampling theory or Azuma’s inequality. The latter can be straightforwardly employed in a wider class of QKD protocols, including those that do not rely on mutually unbiased encoding bases, such as the loss-tolerant (LT) protocol. However, when applied to real-life finite-length QKD experiments, Azuma’s inequality typically results in substantially lower secret-key rates. Here, we propose an alternative security analysis of the LT protocol against general attacks, for both its prepare-and-measure and measure-device-independent versions, that is based on random sampling theory. Consequently, our security proof provides considerably higher secret-key rates than the previous finite-key analysis based on Azuma’s inequality. This work opens up the possibility of using random sampling theory to provide alternative security proofs for other QKD protocols.

Particularly, the paper[67], which appeared one year before his famous dissipativity papers[68,69], already contains a lot of insight on this connection for linear quadratic optimal control problems.Around the same time, the role of a passivity-like variant of dissipativity for inverse optimal control of nonlinear systems was described by Moylan and Anderson[48], a result that triggered a significant amount of research with a peak of activities in the 1990s and monographs such as those by Freeman and Kokotović[22]or by Sepulchre, Jankovic and Kokotović[61].In recent years, research on the linkbetween dissipativity and optimal controlhas been revived with a particular focus onthe turnpike phenomenonand applications in model predictive control (MPC).

[2101.12608] Does injecting linguistic structure into language models lead to better alignment with brain recordings?	Mostafa Abdou Ana Valeria González Mariya Toneva Daniel Hershcovich Anders Søgaard			Neuroscientists evaluate deep neural networks for natural language processing as possible candidate models for how language is processed in the brain. These models are often trained without explicit linguistic supervision, but have been shown to learn some linguistic structure in the absence of such supervision(Manning et al.,2020), potentially questioning the relevance of symbolic linguistic theories in modeling such cognitive processes(Warstadt and Bowman,2020). We evaluate across two fMRI datasets whether language models align better with brain recordings, if their attention is biased by annotations from syntactic or semantic formalisms. Using structure from dependency or minimal recursion semantic annotations, we find alignments improve significantly for one of the datasets. For another dataset, we see more mixed results. We present an extensive analysis of these results. Our proposed approach enables the evaluation of more targeted hypotheses about the composition of meaning in the brain, expanding the range of possible scientific inferences a neuroscientist could make, and opens up new opportunities for cross-pollination between computational neuroscience and linguistics.	
[2101.12609] Open World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning	& Muhammad Ferjad Naeem & Yongqin Xian Zeynep Akata	footnotetext:		Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL) requires to recognize state-object compositions unseen during training. In this work, instead of assuming prior knowledge about the unseen compositions, we operate in the open world setting, where the search space includes a large number of unseen compositions some of which might be unfeasible. In this setting, we start from the cosine similarity between visual features and compositional embeddings. After estimating the feasibility score of each composition, we use these scores to either directly mask the output space or as a margin for the cosine similarity between visual features and compositional embeddings during training. Our experiments on two standard CZSL benchmarks show that all the methods suffer severe performance degradation when applied in the open world setting. While our simple CZSL model achieves state-of-the-art performances in the closed world scenario, our feasibility scores boost the performance of our approach in the open world setting, clearly outperforming the previous state of the art.	
[2101.12610] Role of Water Model on Ion Dissociation at Ambient Conditions	Alec Wills Marivi Fernández-Serra		maria.fernandez-serra@stonybrook.edu alec.wills@stonybrook.edu	We study ion pair dissociation in water at ambient conditions using a combination of classical and ab initio approaches. The goal of this study is to disentangle the sources of discrepancy observed in computed potentials of mean force. In particular we aim to understand why some models favor the stability of solvent-separated ion pairs versus contact ion pairs. We found that some observed differences can be explained by non-converged simulation parameters. However, we also unveil that for some models, small changes in the solution density can have significant effects on modifying the equilibrium balance between the two configurations. We conclude that the thermodynamic stability of contact and solvent-separated ion pairs is very sensitive to the dielectric properties of the underlying simulation model. In general, classical models are very robust on providing a similar estimation of the contact ion pair stability, while this is much more variable in density functional theory-based models. The barrier to transition from solvent-separated to contact ion pair is fundamentally dependent on the balance between electrostatic potential energy and entropy. This reflects the importance of water intra- and inter-molecular polarizability in obtaining an accurate description of the screened ion-ion interactions.

It is generally believed that the temperature of a black hole with non-killing horizon can not be properly defined by the conventional methods used in the equilibrium black holes with killing horizon. In this study, we calculate the spectrum of Hawking radiation of the non-equilibrium black funnel using the Damour-Ruffini method. Our results indicate that the spectrum and the temperatures as well as the chemical potentials of the non-equilibrium black funnel do depend on one of the spatial coordinates. This is different from the equilibrium black holes with killing horizon, where the temperatures are uniform. Therefore, the black hole with non-killing horizon can be overall in non-equilibrium steady state while the Hawking temperature of the black funnel can be viewed as the local temperature and the corresponding Hawking radiation can be regarded as being in the local equilibrium with the horizon of the black funnel. By AdS/CFT, we discuss some possible implications of our results of local Hawking temperature for the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of dual conformal field theory. We further discuss the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of the black funnel, where the first law can be formulated as the entropy production rate being equal to the sum of the changes of the entropies from the system (black funnel) and environments while the second law is given by the entropy production being larger than or equal to zero. We found the time arrow emerged from the nonequilibrium black hole heat and particle transport dissipation. We also discuss how the nonequilibrium dissipation may influence the evaporation process of the black funnel.	black funnel | Nonequilibrium thermodynamics | Hawking radiation | local temperature

Specifically, we simultaneously collected (for the first time) multi-sensor data including urban environmental factors (e.g. air pollution including:PM1, PM2.5, PM10, Oxidised, Reduced, NH3 and Noise, People Count in the vicinity), body reaction (physiological reactions including:EDA, HR, HRV, Body Temperature,BVPand movement) and individuals’ perceived responses (e.g. self-reported valence) in urban settings. Our users followed a pre-specified urban path and collected the data using a comprehensive sensing edge devices. The data is instantly fused, time-stamped and geo-tagged at the point of collection. A range of multivariate statistical analysis techniques have been applied including Principle Component Analysis, Regression and Spatial Visualisations to unravel the relationship between the variables. Results showed thatEDAand Heart Rate VariabilityHRVare noticeably impacted by the level of Particulate Matter (PM) in the environment well with the environmental variables. Furthermore, we adopted Deep Belief Network to extract features from the multimodel data feed which outperformed Convolutional Neural Network and achieved up to (a=80.8% ,=0.001) accuracy.

While, many efforts are focused on securing ground and space segments, especially when national security or large businesses interests are affected, the small-sat, new-space revolution democratizes access to, and exploitation of the near earth orbits. This brings new players to the market, typically in the form of small to medium sized companies, offering new or more affordable services. Despite the necessity and inevitability of this process, it also opens potential new venues for targeted attacks against space-related infrastructure. Smaller organizations, with less established revenue models, have a natural incentive to cut-corners in search for cost optimization and shorter time-to-market[1].While there are many classical anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons using various kinds of effectors (kinetic, RF, laser), we recently observed a proof of concept for a further smart attack of this kind[2], following a more cybernetic approach to attack the information sphere, rather than causing direct energy transfer in orbit. In most cases, satellite operators know very well for their own space assets, where they are localized and with what orbital parameters they fly (e.g., from GNSS receivers on board of their spacecrafts or from their own tracking and ranging facilities). What these operators typically can’t derive just by their own means of observation are the locations and orbital parameters of other objects, such as active and inactive satellites, but more importantly, fields of space debris on a potential collision course with the operator’s space assets[3,4]. Instead, they have to obtain information about such objects by querying two-line element (TLE) debris files provided by Celestrack or Space-Track or any other source. The consequences of orbital collisions don’t have to be discussed here, as are already widely known[5]. To avoid them, orbital conjunction assessment aims at foreseeing possible close encounters, threatening the well being of satellites, monitoring changes in the orbital situation, and engaging in collision avoidance maneuvers, to the degree that propulsion or attitude manipulation allows this[6].Cyber-ASAT[2]describes a method for altering TLE debris to orchestrate fake alarms and unnecessary collision avoidance maneuvers, targeting satellites to exhaust their fuel or jeopardize their availability during collision avoidance. The spectrum of TLE attack possibilities (altering or spoofing) is wide:

Like in path-sampling Monte Carlo, we define an extended configurational space comprising all possible trajectories obtained by iterating the prior distribution by a given number of Markov updates. By enforcing detailed balance conditions between trajectories in the extended configurational space, we validate two prototypical schemes that sample desired target distributions while generating new configurations through truncated Markov Chains. As compared to existing path-sampling methods, trajectories are generated using non-local moves based on Bayesian sampling. Such a complication guarantees reasonable acceptances in the setting considered by this work. Using representative systems, we identify the important factors controlling the quality of the sampling of this type of algorithms. Considering the problem of sampling polymers with fixed endpoints, truncated Markov Chains can outperform an existing algorithm in overstretched conditions. Applications of the proposed methodology range from the design of new generative models to the improvement of the portability of Monte Carlo algorithms, like Configurational Bias schemes, relying on exact sampling of a subset of terms entering the Hamiltonian while generating new configurations.

Rooted into statistical physics, the ERGMs framework has been successfully employed for reconstructing networks, detecting statistically significant patterns in graphs, counting networked configurations with given properties. From a technical point of view, the ERGMs workflow is defined by two subsequent optimization steps: the first one concerns the maximization of Shannon entropy and leads to identify the functional form of the ensemble probability distribution that is maximally non-committal with respect to the missing information; the second one concerns the maximization of the likelihood function induced by this probability distribution and leads to its numerical determination. This second step translates into the resolution of a system ofnon-linear, coupled equations (withbeing the total number of nodes of the network under analysis), a problem that is affected by three main issues, i.e.accuracy,speedandscalability. The present paper aims at addressing these problems by comparing the performance of three algorithms (i.e. Newton’s method, a quasi-Newton method and a recently-proposed fixed-point recipe) in solving several ERGMs, defined by binary and weighted constraints in both a directed and an undirected fashion. While Newton’s method performs best for relatively little networks, the fixed-point recipe is to be preferred when large configurations are considered, as it ensures convergence to the solution within seconds for networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes (e.g. the Internet, Bitcoin). We attach to the paper a Python code implementing the three aforementioned algorithms on all the ERGMs considered in the present work.	pacs:02.10.Ox | 89.75.Hc | 02.70.Rr | 05.10.-a

Our approach is based on the integral representation formula for the solution to the corresponding linear problem in the one-dimensional case, that we will determine through Yagdjian’s Integral Transform approach. As upper bound for the exponent of the nonlinear term, we discover a Glassey-type exponent which depends both on the space dimension and on the Lorentzian metric in the generalized Einstein-de Sitter spacetime.

[2101.12628] 1 Introduction			dnfaiz@unimas.my	This study investigate the effectiveness of using Deep Learning (DL) for the classification of planetary nebulae (PNe). It focusses on distinguishing PNe from other types of objects, as well as their morphological classification. We adopted the deep transfer learning approach using three ImageNet pre-trained algorithms. This study was conducted using images from the Hong Kong/Australian Astronomical Observatory/Strasbourg Observatory H-alpha Planetary Nebula research platform database (HASH DB) and the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS). We found that the algorithm has high success in distinguishing True PNe from other types of objects even without any parameter tuning. The Matthews correlation coefficient is 0.9. Our analysis shows that DenseNet201 is the most effective DL algorithm. For the morphological classification, we found for three classes, Bipolar, Elliptical and Round, half of objects are correctly classified. Further improvement may require more data and/or training. We discuss the trade-offs and potential avenues for future work and conclude that deep transfer learning can be utilized to classify wide-field astronomical images.	deep learning; transfer learning; planetary nebulae; morphology; classification; HASH DB; Pan-STARRS

Dunin-Borkowski Bernd Büchner Bernd Rellinghaus Axel Lubk	Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research IFW Dresden Helmholtzstr. 20 01069 Dresden Germany	a.lubk@ifw-dresden.de	Magnetic skyrmions1are stable topological solitons with complex non-coplanar spin structures. Their nanoscopic size and the low electric currents required to initiate and control their motion has opened a new field of research,skyrmionics, that aims at using skyrmions as information carriers for data storage and manipulation2,3,4,5.Recent advances in skyrmionics prompt for a thorough understanding of the detailed three-dimensional spin texture of a skyrmion6,7,8,9,10,11including skyrmion-skyrmion interactions and their coupling to surfaces and interfaces. These properties crucially affect application-related aspects such as the stability and mobility of skyrmions in confined structures.To date, however, experimental techniques to measure the three-dimensional (3D) spin texture with nanometer resolution are largely missing. We therefore adapt holographic vector field electron tomography12to the problem and report on the first quantitative reconstruction of the 3D spin texture of skyrmions with sub-10 nanometer resolution. The reconstructed textures reveal a variety of previously unseen local deviations from a homogeneous Bloch character within the skyrmion tubes (SkTs), details of the collapse of the skyrmion texture at surfaces, and a correlated modulation of the SkT in FeGe along their tube axes. The quantitative 3D data of the magnetic induction also allow to experimentally confirm some principles of skyrmion formation by deriving spatially resolved maps of the magnetic energy density across these magnetic solitons.	
[2101.12631] A Comprehensive Survey and Experimental Comparison of Graph-Based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search	Mengzhao Wang, Xiaoliang Xu, Qiang Yue, Yuxiang Wang	Hangzhou Dianzi University 	lsswyx@hdu.edu.cn info@vldb.org	Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) constitutes an important operation in a multitude of applications, including recommendation systems, information retrieval, and pattern recognition. In the past decade, graph-based ANNS algorithms have been the leading paradigm in this domain, with dozens of graph-based ANNS algorithms proposed. Such algorithms aim to provide effective, efficient solutions for retrieving the nearest neighbors for a given query. Nevertheless, these efforts focus on developing and optimizing algorithms with different approaches, so there is a real need for a comprehensive survey about the approaches’ relative performance, strengths, and pitfalls. Thus here we provide a thorough comparative analysis and experimental evaluation of 13 representative graph-based ANNS algorithms via a new taxonomy and fine-grained pipeline. We compared each algorithm in a uniform test environment on eight real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets with varying sizes and characteristics. Our study yields novel discoveries, offerings several useful principles to improve algorithms, thus designing an optimized method that outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. This effort also helped us pinpoint algorithms’ working portions, along with rule-of-thumb recommendations about promising research directions and suitable algorithms for practitioners in different fields.	
[2101.12632] The Deep Radial Basis Function Data Descriptor (D-RBFDD) Network: A One-Class Neural Network for Anomaly Detection	Mehran H. Z. Bazargani, Arjun Pakrashi, Brian Mac Namee	School of Computer ScienceInsight Centre for Data AnalyticsUniversity College Dublin (UCD)Dublin 	mehran.hosseinzadehbazarga@ucdconnect.ie	Anomaly detection is a challenging problem in machine learning, and is even more so when dealing with instances that are captured in low-level, raw data representations without a well-behaved set of engineered features. The Radial Basis Function Data Descriptor (RBFDD) network is an effective solution for anomaly detection, however, it is a shallow model that does not deal effectively with raw data representations. This paper investigates approaches to modifying the RBFDD network to transform it into a deep one-class classifier suitable for anomaly detection problems with low-level raw data representations. We show that approaches based on transfer learning are not effective and our results suggest that this is because the latent representations learned by generic classification models are not suitable for anomaly detection. Instead we show that an approach that adds multiple convolutional layers before the RBF layer, to form a Deep Radial Basis Function Data Descriptor (D-RBFDD) network, is very effective. This is shown in a set of evaluation experiments using multiple anomaly detection scenarios created from publicly available image classification datasets, and a real-world anomaly detection dataset in which different types of arrhythmia are detected in electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Our experiments show that the D-RBFDD network out-performs state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods including the Deep Support Vector Data Descriptor (Deep SVDD), One-Class SVM, and Isolation Forest on the image datasets, and produces competitive results for the ECG dataset.

The quasars have redshiftsand luminosities. We employ ultraviolet spectral reconstructions based on an independent component analysis to parametrize the\ionCiv1549-emission line that is used to infer the strength of accretion disc winds, and the\ionHeii1640 line, an indicator of the soft X-ray flux. We find that radio-detected quasars are found in the same region of\ionCiv blueshift versus equivalent-width space as radio-undetected quasars, but that the loudest, most luminous and largest radio sources exist preferentially at low\ionCiv blueshifts. Additionally, the radio-detection fraction increases with blueshift whereas the radio-loud fraction decreases. In the radio-quiet population, we observe a range of\ionHeii equivalent widths as well as a Baldwin effect with bolometric luminosity, whilst the radio-loud population has mostly strong\ionHeii, consistent with a stronger soft X-ray flux. The presence of strong\ionHeii is a necessary but not sufficient condition to detect radio-loud emission suggesting some degree of stochasticity in jet formation. Using energetic arguments and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore the plausibility of winds, compact jets, and star formation as sources of the radio quiet emission, ruling out none. The existence of quasars with similar ultraviolet properties but differing radio properties suggests, perhaps, that the radio and ultraviolet emission is tracing activity occurring on different time-scales.	accretion | accretion discs – galaxies: jets – quasars: emission lines – quasars: general – galaxies: star formation – radio continuum: galaxies

Current state-of-the-art models for this task assume that all documents are of the same type (e.g. news articles) or fall under the same theme. However, it is also desirable to perform CDCR across different domains (type or theme). A particular use case we focus on in this paper is the resolution of entities mentioned across scientific work and newspaper articles that discuss them. Identifying the same entities and corresponding concepts in both scientific articles and news can help scientists understand how their work is represented in mainstream media. We propose a new task and English language dataset for cross-document cross-domain co-reference resolution (CDCR). The task aims to identify links between entities across heterogeneous document types. We show that in this cross-domain, cross-document setting, existing CDCR models do not perform well and we provide a baseline model that outperforms current state-of-the-art CDCR models on CDCR. Our data set, annotation tool and guidelines as well as our model for cross-document cross-domain co-reference are all supplied as open access open source resources.

Our main results reveal how orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle provide a useful tool for finding such a formula for some values of. The main idea is to realize the elliptical disk as the numerical range of a matrix and the problem reduces to finding the eigenvalues of that matrix.

In this paper we optimizefor the game of Bridge, avoiding useless computations. The proposed optimizations are general and apply to other imperfect information turn-based games. We define multiple optimizations involving Pareto fronts, and show that these optimizations speed up the search. Some of these optimizations are cuts that stop the search at a node, while others keep track of which possible worlds have become redundant, avoiding unnecessary, costly evaluations. We also measure the benefits of parallelizing the double dummy searches at the leaves of thesearch tree.

While some studies showed gains from incorporating source-side symbolic syntactic and semantic structure into text generation Transformers, very little work addressed the decoding of such structure. We propose a general approach for tree decoding using a transition-based approach. Examining the challenging test case of incorporating Universal Dependencies syntax into machine translation, we present substantial improvements on test sets that focus on syntactic generalization, while presenting improved or comparable performance on standard MT benchmarks. Further qualitative analysis addresses cases where syntactic generalization in the vanilla Transformer decoder is inadequate and demonstrates the advantages afforded by integrating syntactic information.111Code can be found inhttps://github.com/borgr/nematus/tree/generation	
[2101.12641] Gas flow in Martian spider formation	Nicholas Attree111Corresponding author Erika Kaufmann Axel Hagermann		n.o.attree@stir.ac.uk	Martian araneiform terrain, located in the Southern polar regions, consists of features with central pits and radial troughs which are thought to be associated with the solid state greenhouse effect under a COice sheet. Sublimation at the base of this ice leads to gas buildup, fracturing of the ice and the flow of gas and entrained regolith out of vents and onto the surface. There are two possible pathways for the gas: through the gap between the ice slab and the underlying regolith, as proposed byKieffer (2007), or through the pores of a permeable regolith layer, which would imply that regolith properties can control the spacing between adjacent spiders, as suggested byHao et al. (2019). We test this hypothesis quantitatively in order to place constraints on the regolith properties. Based on previously estimated flow rates and thermophysical arguments, we suggest that there is insufficient depth of porous regolith to support the full gas flow through the regolith. By contrast, free gas flow through a regolith–ice gap is capable of supplying the likely flow rates for gap sizes on the order of a centimetre. This size of gap can be opened in the centre of a spider feature by gas pressure bending the overlying ice slab upwards, or by levitating it entirely as suggested in the originalKieffer (2007)model. Our calculations therefore support at least some of the gas flowing through a gap opened between the regolith and ice. Regolith properties most likely still play a role in the evolution of spider morphology, by regolith cohesion controlling the erosion of the central pit and troughs, for example.

In order to make effective decisions they need to simultaneously monitor various attributes of the pandemic such as transmission rate and infection rate for disease prevention, recovery rate which indicates treatment effectiveness as well as the mortality rate and others. This work presents a technique for monitoring the pandemic by employing an Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered Death model regularly estimated by an augmented particle Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme in which the posterior distribution samples are monitored via Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Average process monitoring. This is illustrated on the COVID-19 data for the State of Qatar.

The cloud is trapped in an elongated potential such that that transverse spin excitations are frozen. We extract the non-linear parameter with three different manipulation protocols. The outcomes are all consistent with a simple local density approximation of the spin hydrodynamics, i.e., of the so-called Bose-Josephson junction equations. We also identify a method to produce states with a well defined uniform magnetization.	
[2101.12644] 5G Network Slicing for Wi-Fi Networks	Matteo Nerini David Palma	Department of Information Security andCommunication TechnologyNTNU – Norwegian University of Science and TechnologyTrondheim NorwayEmail:	david.palma@ntnu.no matteon@stud.ntnu.no	Future networks will pave the way for a myriad of applications with different requirements and Wi-Fi will play an important role in local area networks. This is why network slicing is proposed by 5G networks, allowing to offer multiple logical networks tailored to the different user requirements, over a common infrastructure. However, this is not supported by current Wi-Fi networks. In this paper, we propose a standard-compliant network slicing approach for the radio access segment of Wi-Fi by defining multipleService Set Identifiers (SSIDs)perAccess Point (AP). We present two algorithms, one that assigns resources according to the requirements of slices in a static way, and another that dynamically configures the slices according to the network’s conditions and relevantKey Performance Indicators (KPIs). The proposed algorithms were validated through extensive simulations, conducted in thens-3network simulator, and complemented by theoretical assessments. The obtained results reveal that the two proposed slicing approaches outperform today’s Wi-Fi access technique, reaching lower error probability for bandwidth intensive slices and lower latency for time-critical slices. Simultaneously, the proposed approach is up to 32 times more energy efficient, when considering slices tailored for low-power and low-bandwidth devices, while increasing the overall spectrum efficiency.

[2101.12648] Defect 𝑎-Theorem and 𝑎-Maximization				Conformal defects describe the universal behaviors of a conformal field theory (CFT) in the presence of a boundary or more general impurities. The coupled critical system is characterized by new conformal anomalies which are analogous to, and generalize those of standalone CFTs. Here we study the conformal- and-anomalies of four dimensional defects in CFTs of general spacetime dimensions greater than four. We prove that under unitary defect renormalization group (RG) flows, the defect-anomaly must decrease, thus establishing the defect-theorem. For conformal defects preserving minimal supersymmetry, the full defect symmetry contains a distinguishedsubgroup. We derive the anomaly multiplet relations that express the defect- and-anomalies in terms of the defect (mixed) ’t Hooft anomalies for thissymmetry. Once thesymmetry is identified using the defect-maximization principle which we prove, this enables a non-perturbative pathway to the conformal anomalies of strongly coupled defects. We illustrate our methods by discussing a number of examples including boundaries in five dimensions and codimension-two defects in six dimensions. We also comment on chiral algebra sectors of defect operator algebras and potential conformal collider bounds on defect anomalies.

The challenge is of improving bandwidth with limited spectrum and power consumption, which however has gradually become a bottleneck with evolution going on. The intrinsic problem is that communication is modeled as a message transportation from sender to receiver and pursues for an exact message replication in Shannon’s information theory, which certainly leads to large bandwidth and power requirements with data explosion. However, the goal for communication among intelligent agents, entities with intelligence including humans, is to understand the meaning or semantics underlying data, not an accurate recovery of the transmitted messages. The separate first transmission and then understanding is a waste on bandwidth. In this article, we deploy semantics to solve the spectrum and power bottleneck and propose a first understanding and then transmission framework with high semantic fidelity. We first give a brief introduction of semantics covering the definition and properties to show the insights and scope of this paper. Then the proposed communication towards semantic fidelity framework is introduced, which takes the above mentioned properties into account to further improve efficiency. Specially, a semantic transformation is introduced to transform the input into semantic symbols. Different from the conventional transformations in signal processing area, for example discrete cosine transform, the transformation is with data loss, which is also the reason that the proposed framework can achieve large bandwidth saving with high semantic fidelity. Besides, we also discuss semantic noise and performance measurement. To evaluate the effectiveness, a case study of audio transmission is carried out. Finally, we discuss the typical applications and open challenges.	semantics | intelligent communication | semantic communication | semantic symbols | semantic transformation | semantic fidelity

[2101.12651] One dimensional martingale rearrangement couplings	B. Jourdain W. Margheriti11footnotemark:1	Université Paris-Est Cermics (ENPC) INRIA F-77455 Marne-la-Vallée France. E-mails: - This research benefited from the support of the “Chaire Risques Financiers” Fondation du Risque.	william.margheriti@enpc.fr benjamin.jourdain@enpc.fr	We are interested in martingale rearrangement couplings. As introduced by Wiesel[37]in order to prove the stability of Martingale Optimal Transport problems, these are projections in adapted Wasserstein distance of couplings between two probability measures on the real line in the convex order onto the set of martingale couplings between these two marginals. In reason of the lack of relative compactness of the set of couplings with given marginals for the adapted Wasserstein topology, the existence of such a projection is not clear at all. Under a barycentre dispersion assumption on the original coupling which is in particular satisfied by the Hoeffding-Fréchet or comonotone coupling, Wiesel gives a clear algorithmic construction of a martingale rearrangement when the marginals are finitely supported and then gets rid of the finite support assumption by relying on a rather messy limiting procedure to overcome the lack of relative compactness. Here, we give a direct general construction of a martingale rearrangement coupling under the barycentre dispersion assumption. This martingale rearrangement is obtained from the original coupling by an approach similar to the construction we gave in[24]of the inverse transform martingale coupling, a member of a family of martingale couplings close to the Hoeffding-Fréchet coupling, but for a slightly different injection in the set of extended couplings introduced by Beiglböck and Juillet[9]and which involve the uniform distribution onin addition to the two marginals. We last discuss the stability in adapted Wassertein distance of the inverse transform martingale coupling with respect to the marginal distributions.

The goal of QGT is to detect defective items from a data set of sizewith counting measurements, each of which counts the number of defects in a selected pool of items. While most literatures consider either probabilistic QGT with random noise or combinatorial QGT with noiseless measurements, our focus is on the combinatorial QGT with noisy measurements that might be adversarially perturbed by additive bounded noises. Since perfect detection is impossible, a partial detection criterion is adopted. With the adversarial noise being bounded byand the detection criterion being to ensure no more thanerrors can be made, our goal is to characterize the fundamental limit on the number of measurement, termedpooling complexity, as well as provide explicit construction of measurement plans with optimal pooling complexity and efficient decoding algorithms. We first show that the fundamental limit isto within a constant factor not depending onfor the non-adaptive setting when, sharpening the previous result by Chen and Wang[2]. We also provide an explicit construction of a non-adaptive deterministic measurement plan withpooling complexity up to a constant factor, matching the fundamental limit, with decoding complexity beingfor all, nearly linear in, the size of the data set. Our construction combines Hadamard matrices and lossless unbalanced bipartite expanders based on a novel embedding approach.

They are studied solving rigorous three-particle scattering equations for transition operators in the momentum space. The dependence of the three-boson resonance energy and width on the two-boson scattering length is studied with several force models. The universal limit is determined numerically considering highly excited states; simple parametrizations for the resonance energy and width in terms of the scattering length are established. Decreasing the attraction, the resonances rise not much above the threshold but broaden rapidly and become physically unobservable, evolving into subthreshold resonances. Finite-range effects are studied and related to those in the bound-state regime.	pacs:21.30.-x | 21.45.-v

In the classical algebraic context it is important to distinguish between tame and wild ramification. Noether’s theorem characterizes tame ramification in terms of a normal basis and tame ramification can also be detected via the surjectivity of the trace map. We transfer the latter fact to ring spectra and use the Tate cohomology spectrum to detect wild ramification in the context of commutative ring spectra. We study ramification in examples in the context of topological K-theory and topological modular forms.

The parameter calibration problem is considered as optimal control problem that is investigated from a theoretical and numerical point of view. We prove the existence of optimal controls, derive the corresponding first order optimality system and formulate a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to identify parameters for given data sets. To validate the approach we use real data sets from traffic and crowd dynamics to fit the parameters. The results are compared to forces corresponding to well-known interaction models such as the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model for traffic and the social force model for crowd motion.

We propose several improvements on the current state of the art, and we apply them to the GWTC-2 catalog of LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave (GW) detections, and the GLADE galaxy catalog, performing a detailed study of several sources of systematic errors that, with the expected increase in statistics, will eventually become the dominant limitation.

Combining dark sirens with the counterpart for GW170817 we find.

Stefanis	thanks:	mikhs@theor.jinr.ru pimikov@mail.ru stefanis@tp2.ruhr-uni-bochum.de	We show that using renormalization-group summation to generate the QCD radiative corrections to thetransition form factor, calculated with lightcone sum rules (LCSR), renders the strong coupling free of Landau singularities while preserving the QCD form-factor asymptotics. This enables a reliable applicability of the LCSR method to momenta well below 1 GeV. This way, one can use the new preliminary BESIII data with unprecedented accuracy below 1.5 GeVto fine tune the prefactor of the twist-six contribution. Using a combined fit to all available data below 3.1 GeV, we are able to determine all nonperturbative scale parameters and a few Gegenbauer coefficients entering the calculation of the form factor. Employing these ingredients, we determine a pion distribution amplitude with conformal coefficientsthat agree at thelevel with the data forGeVand fulfill at the same time the lattice constraints onat NLO together with the constraints from QCD sum rules with nonlocal condensates. The form-factor prediction calculated herewith reproduces the data below 1 GeVsignificantly better than analogous predictions based on a fixed-order power-series expansion in the strong coupling constant.	pacs:11.10.Hi | 12.38Bx | 12.38.Cy | 12.38.Lg

The tool of choice is an effective model built from one-loop expressions of the field determinants of gluon and ghost, in the presence of a Polyakov loop background field. We show that the curvature masses associated with the Cartan angles, which serve as a proxy to study the-gluon screening mass, show a characteristic dip in the vicinity of the transition temperature. The strength of the observables, which reflects a competition between the confining and the deconfining forces, is sensitive to assumptions of dynamics, and thus provides an interesting link between thevacuum structure and the properties of gluon and ghost propagators.

We also give explicit examples to show that these conditions on the scalar curvature are necessary.

A general 4-order tensor model that enables computationally efficient DOA estimation is designed. Whereas other tensor decomposition-based methods treat all factor matrices as arbitrary, the essence of the proposed DOA estimation method is to fully exploit the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrices to take advantage of the shift-invariance between and within different subarrays. Specifically, the received signal of TB MIMO radar is expressed as a 4-order tensor. Depending on the target Doppler shifts, the constructed tensor is reshaped into two distinct 3-order tensors. A computationally efficient tensor decomposition method is proposed to decompose the Vandermonde factor matrices. The generators of the Vandermonde factor matrices are computed to estimate the phase rotations between subarrays, which can be utilized as a look-up table for finding target DOA. It is further shown that our proposed method can be used in a more general scenario where the subarray structures can be arbitrary but identical. The proposed DOA estimation method requires no prior information about the tensor rank and is guaranteed to achieve precise decomposition result. Simulation results illustrate the performance improvement of the proposed DOA estimation method as compared to conventional DOA estimation techniques for TB MIMO Radar.

[2101.12667] The Census of Exoplanets in Visual Binaries: population trends from a volume-limited Gaia DR2 and literature search	Clémence Fontanive Daniella Bardalez Gagliuffi	Center for Space and Habitability University of Bern Bern Switzerland		We present results from an extensive search in the literature andGaiaDR2 for visual co-moving binary companions to stars hosting exoplanets and brown dwarfs within 200 pc. We found 218 planet hosts out of the 938 in our sample to be part of multiple-star systems, with 10 newly discovered binaries and 2 new tertiary stellar components. This represents an overall raw multiplicity rate offor hosts to exoplanets across all spectral types, with multi-planet systems found to have a lower stellar duplicity frequency at the 2.2-level. We found that more massive hosts are more often in binary configurations, and that planet-bearing stars in multiple systems are predominantly observed to be the most massive component of stellar binaries. Investigations of the multiplicity of planetary systems as a function of planet mass and separation revealed that giant planets with masses above 0.1 Mare more frequently seen in stellar binaries than small sub-Jovian planets with a 3.6-difference, a trend enhanced for the most massive (7 M) short-period (0.5 AU) planets and brown dwarf companions. Binarity was however found to have no significant effect on the demographics of low-mass planets (0.1 M) or warm and cool gas giants (0.5 AU). While stellar companion mass appears to have no impact on planet properties, binary separation seems to be an important factor in the resulting structure of planetary systems. Stellar companions on separations1000 AU can play a role in the formation or evolution of massive, close-in planets, while planets in wider binaries show similar properties to planets orbiting single stars. Finally, our analyses indicate that numerous stellar companions on separations smaller than 1–3 arcsec likely remain undiscovered to this date. Continuous efforts to complete our knowledge of stellar multiplicity on separations of tens to hundreds of AU are essential to confirm the reported trends and further our understanding of the roles played by multiplicity on exoplanets.	exoplanets | multiplicity | visual | binaries | companions | formation | demographics | statistics

Warrington	Center for Theoretical Physics Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge MA 02139 USAThe NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions		Path integral contour deformations have been shown to mitigate sign and signal-to-noise problems associated with phase fluctuations in lattice field theories. We define a family of contour deformations applicable tolattice gauge theory that can reduce sign and signal-to-noise problems associated with complex actions and complex observables. For observables, these contours can be used to define deformed observables with identical expectation value but different variance. As a proof-of-principle, we apply machine learning techniques to optimize the deformed observables associated with Wilson loops in two dimensionalandgauge theory. We study loops consisting of up to 64 plaquettes and achieve variance reduction of up to 4 orders of magnitude.	
[2101.12669] Characteristic measures for language stable subshifts	Van Cyr Bryna Kra	Bucknell University Lewisburg PA 17837	kra@math.northwestern.edu van.cyr@bucknell.edu	We consider the problem of when a symbolic dynamical system supports a Borel probability measure that is invariant under every element of its automorphism group. It follows readily from a classical result of Parry that the full shift on finitely many symbols, and more generally any mixing subshift of finite type, supports such a measure. Frisch and Tamuz recently dubbed such measures characteristic, and further showed that every zero entropy subshift has a characteristic measure. While it remains open if every subshift over a finite alphabet has a characteristic measure, we define a new class of shifts, which we call language stable subshifts, and show that these shifts have characteristic measures. This is a large class that is generic in several senses and contains numerous positive entropy examples.	Key words and phrases:subshift | block complexity

[2101.12671] Covering a compact space by fixed-radius or growing random balls	David J. Aldous	Department of Statistics 367 Evans Hall # 3860 U.C. Berkeley CA 94720; www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/aldous.	aldous@stat.berkeley.edu	Simple random coverage models, well studied in Euclidean space, can also be defined on a general compact metric space. By analogy with the geometric models, and with the discrete coupon collector’s problem and with cover times for finite Markov chains, one expects a “weak concentration” bound for the distribution of the cover time to hold under minimal assumptions. We give two such results, one for random fixed-radius balls and the other for sequentially arriving randomly-centered and deterministically growing balls. Each is in fact a simple application of a different more general bound, the former concerning coverage by i.i.d. random sets with arbitrary distribution, and the latter concerning hitting times for Markov chains with a strong monotonicity property. The growth model seems generally more tractable, and we record some basic results and open problems for that model.

Focusing on a special class of network topology – chordal networks – we investigate algorithmic aspects of the TIM problem under adversarial topology perturbation. In particular, given the adversarial perturbation with respect to edge insertion/deletion, we propose a dynamic graph coloring algorithm that allows for aconstantnumber of re-coloring updates against each inserted/deleted edge to achieve the information-theoretic optimality. This is a sharp reduction of the general graph re-coloring, whose optimal number of updates scales as the size of the network, thanks to the delicate exploitation of the structural properties of chordal graph classes.

Mazin	Center for Computational Materials Science U.S. Naval Research Laboratory Washington DC 20375 	darshana.wickramaratne@nrl.navy.mil	Hybrid Ising superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures provide a unique opportunity to explore the interplay between proximity-induced magnetism, spin-orbit coupling and superconductivity. Here we use a combination of first-principles calculations of NbSe/CrBrheterostructures and an analytical theory of Ising superconductivity to analyze the existing experiments and provide a complete explanation of highly nontrivial and largely counterintuitive effects: anincreasein the magnitude of the superconducting gap accompanied by thebroadeningof the tunneling peaks; hysteretic behavior of the tunneling conductance that sets inK below; and nematic symmetry breaking in the superconducting state. The microscopic reason in all three cases appears to be the interplay between the proximity-induced exchange splitting and intrinsic defects. Finally, we predict additional interesting effects that at the moment cannot be addressed experimentally: spin-filtering when tunneling across CrBrand tunneling “hot spots” in momentum space that are anticorrelated with regions where the spin-orbit splitting is maximum.

Keywords: Alternating resolvents; maximal monotone operators; proximal point algorithm; metastability; proof mining.	Bruno Dinis Pedro Pinto	thanks:	bmdinis@fc.ul.pt pinto@mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de	A generalized method of alternating resolvents was introduced by Boikanyo and Moroşanu as a way to approximate common zeros of two maximal monotone operators. In this paper we analyse the strong convergence of this algorithm under two different sets of conditions. As a consequence we obtain effective rates of metastability (in the sense of Terence Tao) and quasi-rates of asymptotic regularity. Furthermore, we bypass the need for sequential weak compactness in the original proofs. Our quantitative results are obtained using proof-theoretical techniques in the context of the proof mining program.

[2101.12677] Diminishing Domain Bias by Leveraging Domain Labels in Object Detection on UAVs	Benjamin Kiefer, Martin Messmerand Andreas ZellUniversity of Tübingen	These two authors contributed work has been supported by the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy Project Avalon FKZ: 03SX481B.	forename.surname@uni-tuebingen.de	Object detection from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is of great importance in many aerial vision-based applications. Despite the great success of generic object detection methods, a significant performance drop is observed when applied to images captured by UAVs. This is due to large variations in imaging conditions, such as varying altitudes, dynamically changing viewing angles, and different capture times. These variations lead to domain imbalances and, thus, trained models suffering from domain bias. We demonstrate that domain knowledge is a valuable source of information and thus propose domain-aware object detectors by using freely accessible sensor data. By splitting the model into cross-domain and domain-specific parts, substantial performance improvements are achieved on multiple data sets across various models and metrics without changing the architecture. In particular, we achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on UAVDT for embedded real-time detectors. Furthermore, we create a new airborne image data set by annotating 13,713 objects in 2,900 images featuring precise altitude and viewing angle annotations.	
[2101.12678] Total Stability of SVMs and Localized SVMs	Hannes KöhlerandAndreas ChristmannDepartment of Mathematics, University of Bayreuth, Germany	Corresponding author;	hannes.koehler@uni-bayreuth.de	Regularized kernel-based methods such as support vector machines (SVMs) typically depend on the underlying probability measureP(respectively an empirical measurein applications) as well as on the regularization parameterand the kernel. Whereas classical statistical robustness only considers the effect of small perturbations inP, the present paper investigates the influence of simultaneous slight variations in the whole triple, respectively, on the resulting predictor. Existing results from the literature are considerably generalized and improved. In order to also make them applicable to big data, where regular SVMs suffer from their super-linear computational requirements, we show how our results can be transferred to the context of localized learning. Here, the effect of slight variations in the applied regionalization, which might for example stem from changes inPrespectively, is considered as well.

Valerio 2, I-34100, Trieste, Italy	E-mail:	marco.palla@inaf.it	"We study the effect of different Type Ia SN nucleosynthesis prescriptions on the Milky Way chemical evolution. To this aim, we run detailed one-infall and two-infall chemical evolution models, adopting a large compilation of yield sets corresponding to different white dwarf progenitors (near-Chandrasekar and sub-Chandrasekar) taken from the literature. We adopt a fixed delay time distribution function for Type Ia SNe , in order to avoid degeneracies in the analysis of the different nucleosynthesis channels. We also combine yields for different Type Ia SN progenitors in order to test the contribution to chemical evolution of different Type Ia SN channels. The results of the models are compared with recent LTE and NLTE observational data. We find that ""classical"" W7 and WDD2 models produce Fe masses and [/Fe] abundance patterns similar to more recent and physical near-Chandrasekar and sub-Chandrasekar models. For Fe-peak elements, we find that the results strongly depend either on the white dwarf explosion mechanism (deflagration-to-detonation, pure deflagration, double detonation) or on the initial white dwarf conditions (central density, explosion pattern). The comparison of chemical evolution model results with observations suggests that a combination of near-Chandrasekar and sub-Chandrasekar yields is necessary to reproduce the data of V, Cr, Mn and Ni, with different fractions depending on the adopted massive stars stellar yields. This comparison also suggests that NLTE and singly ionised abundances should be definitely preferred when dealing with most of Fe-peak elements at low metallicity."	stars: supernovae: general - Galaxy: abundances - Galaxy: stellar content

The second is the monodromy stratification defined by Bogomolov, Petrov and Tschinkel. The main result of the paper is a classification of all positive-dimensional ambi-typical strata, that is, strata which are both Shimada root strata and monodromy strata. We also discuss the relationship with moduli spaces of lattice-polarisedsurfaces. The appendix by M. Kirschmer contains computational results about the-dimensional ambi-typical strata.	
[2101.12690] Towards Generalising Neural Implicit Representations	Theo W. CostainVictor A. Prisacariu	institutetext:		Neural implicit representations have shown substantial improvements in efficiently storing 3D data, when compared to conventional formats. However, the focus of existing work has mainly been on storage and subsequent reconstruction. In this work, we show that training neural representations for reconstruction tasks alongside conventional tasks can produce more general encodings that admit equal quality reconstructions to single task training, whilst improving results on conventional tasks when compared to single task encodings. We reformulate the semantic segmentation task, creating a more representative task for implicit representation contexts, and through multi-task experiments on reconstruction, classification, and segmentation, show our approach learns feature rich encodings that admit equal performance for each task. Further, through hold-out experiments, we show that adding semantic supervision when training implicit encoders can significantly improve performance on later unseen tasks, without requiring encoder retraining.

[2101.12693] Evaluating the Discrimination Ability of Proper Multivariate Scoring Rules	C. Alexander M. Coulon Y. Han X. Meng	Department of Accounting and Finance University of Sussex Business School Falmer Brighton BN1 9SL United Kingdom		Proper scoring rules are commonly applied to quantify the accuracy of distribution forecasts. Given an observation they assign a scalar score to each distribution forecast, with the the lowest expected score attributed to the true distribution. The energy and variogram scores are two rules that have recently gained some popularity in multivariate settings because their computation does not require a forecast to have parametric density function and so they are broadly applicable. Here we conduct a simulation study to compare the discrimination ability between the energy score and three variogram scores. Compared with other studies, our simulation design is more realistic because it is supported by a historical data set containing commodity prices, currencies and interest rates, and our data generating processes include a diverse selection of models with different marginal distributions, dependence structure, and calibration windows. This facilitates a comprehensive comparison of the performance of proper scoring rules in different settings. To compare the scores we use three metrics: the mean relative score, error rate and a generalised discrimination heuristic. Overall, we find that the variogram score with parameteroutperforms the energy score and the other two variogram scores.

By design, it helps alleviate the challenges coming with the vast variances in objects’ scales, naturally inherent to UAV data sets. Furthermore, it improves inference speed by two to three times on average. We test this extensively on UAVDT, VisDrone, and on a new data set we captured ourselves and achieve consistent improvements while being considerably faster. Moreover, we show how to apply this method to generic UAV object detection tasks. Additionally, we successfully test our approach on a height transfer task where we train on some interval of altitudes and test on a different one.

[2101.12696] Skyrmion Generation from Irreversible Fission of Stripes in Chiral Multilayer Films	Anthony K.C. Tan James Lourembam Xiaoye Chen Pin Ho Hang Khume Tan Anjan Soumyanarayanan	thanks:	anjan@imre.a-star.edu.sg	Competing interactions produce finite-sized textures in myriad condensed matter systems – typically forming elongated “stripe” or round “bubble” domains. Transitions between stripe and bubble phases, driven by field or temperature, are expected to be reversible in nature. Here we report on the distinct character of the analogous transition for nanoscale spin textures in chiral Co/Pt-based multilayer films - known to host Néel skyrmions - using microscopy, magnetometry, and micromagnetic simulations. Upon increasing field, individual stripes fission into multiple skyrmions, and this transition exhibits a macroscopic signature of irreversibility. Crucially, upon field reversal, the skyrmions do not fuse back into stripes – with many skyrmions retaining their morphology down to zero field. Both the macroscopic irreversibility and the microscopic zero field skyrmion density are governed by the thermodynamic material parameter determining chiral domain stability. These results establish the thermodynamic and microscopic framework underlying ambient skyrmion generation and stability in chiral multilayer films and provide immediate directions for their functionalization in devices.

We consider two past lightcones, the first,, is associated with the physical observerwho describes the actual physical spacetime geometry ofat the length scale, whereas the second,, is associated with an idealized version of the observerwho, notwithstanding the presence of local inhomogeneities at the given scale, wish to modelwith a memberof the family of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes. In such a framework, we discuss a number of mathematical results that allows a rigorous comparison between the two lightconesand. In particular, we introduce a scale dependent () lightcone-comparison functional, defined by a harmonic type energy, associated with a natural map between the physicaland the FLRW reference lightcone. This functional has a number of remarkable properties, in particular it vanishes iff, at the given length-scale, the corresponding lightcone surface sections (the celestial spheres) are isometric. We discuss in detail its variational analysis and prove the existence of a minimum that characterizes a natural scale-dependent distance functional between the two lightcones. We also indicate how it is possible to extend our results to the case when caustics develop on the physical past lightcone. Finally, we show how the distance functional is related to spacetime scalar curvature in the causal past of the two lightcones, and briefly illustrate a number of its possible applications.

To better exploit its potential in the coming decade, perhaps a rigorous framework for reasoning about deep learning is needed, which however is not easy to build due to the intricate details of neural networks. For near-term purposes, a practical alternative is to develop a mathematically tractable surrogate model yet maintaining many characteristics of neural networks. This paper proposes a model of this kind that we term the Layer-Peeled Model. The effectiveness of this model is evidenced by, among others, its ability to reproduce a known empirical pattern and to predict a hitherto unknown phenomenon when training deep learning models on imbalanced datasets.\authorcontributionsC.F., H.H, Q.L., and W.J.S. designed research; C.F., H.H, and W.J.S. performed research and analyzed data; and C.F., H.H, Q.L., and W.J.S. wrote the paper.\authordeclarationThe authors declare no competing interest.\correspondingauthor1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Evans Sarah Jenkins Simon O’Keefe Angelika Sebald Susan Stepney Fernando Torre Martin Trefzer	Department of Computer Science University of York 	matt.dale@york.ac.uk	Advances in artificial intelligence are driven by technologies inspired by the brain, but these technologies are orders of magnitude less powerful and energy efficient than biological systems. Inspired by the nonlinear dynamics of neural networks, new unconventional computing hardware has emerged with the potential for extreme parallelism and ultra-low power consumption. Physical reservoir computing demonstrates this with a variety of unconventional systems from optical-based to spintronic[1]. Reservoir computers provide a nonlinear projection of the task input into a high-dimensional feature space by exploiting the system’s internal dynamics. A trained readout layer then combines features to perform tasks, such as pattern recognition and time-series analysis. Despite progress, achieving state-of-the-art performance without external signal processing to the reservoir remains challenging. Here we show, through simulation, that magnetic materials in thin-film geometries can realise reservoir computers with greater than or similar accuracy to digital recurrent neural networks. Our results reveal that basic spin properties of magnetic films generate the required nonlinear dynamics and memory to solve machine learning tasks. Furthermore, we show that neuromorphic hardware can be reduced in size by removing the need for discrete neural components and external processing. The natural dynamics and nanoscale size of magnetic thin-films present a new path towards fast energy-efficient computing with the potential to innovate portable smart devices, self driving vehicles, and robotics.

Consistency requires that two systems brought into infinitesimal coupling be able to rearrange their timescales in order that all their temperatures match: this time reorganisation is only possible because the systems have a set of time-reparametrization invariances, that are thus seen to be an essential component of the scenario.

To improve the communication efficiency of FL implementations in wireless systems, recent works have proposed compression and dimension reduction mechanisms, along with digital and analog transmission schemes that account for channel noise, fading, and interference. The prior art hasmainlyfocused on star topologies consisting of distributed clients and a central server. In contrast, this paper studies FL over wireless device-to-device (D2D) networks by providing theoretical insights into the performance of digital and analog implementations of decentralized stochastic gradient descent (DSGD). First, we introduce generic digital and analog wireless implementations of communication-efficient DSGD algorithms, leveraging random linear coding (RLC) for compression and over-the-air computation (AirComp) for simultaneous analog transmissions. Next, under the assumptions of convexity and connectivity, we provide convergence bounds for both implementations. The results demonstrate the dependence of the optimality gap on the connectivity and on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels in the network. The analysis is corroborated by experiments on an image-classification task.

Recent developments in astronomical observations enable direct imaging of circumstellar disks. Precise characterization of such extended structure is essential to our understanding of stellar systems. However, the faint intensity of the circumstellar disks compared to the brightness of the host star compels astronomers to use tailored observation strategies, in addition to state-of-the-art optical devices. Even then, extracting the signal of circumstellar disks heavily relies on post-processing techniques. In this work, we propose a morphological component analysis (MCA) approach that leverages low-complexity models of both the disks and the stellar light corrupting the data. In addition to disks, our method allows to image exoplanets. Our approach is tested through numerical experiments.

[2101.12708] Between Steps: Intermediate Relaxations between big-M and Convex Hull Formulations	Jan Kronqvist Ruth Misener Calvin Tsay	institutetext:		This work develops a class of relaxations in between the big-M and convex hull formulations of disjunctions, drawing advantages from both. The proposed “-split” formulations split convex additively separable constraints intopartitions and form the convex hull of the partitioned disjuncts. Parameterrepresents the trade-off of model size vs. relaxation strength. We examine the novel formulations and prove that, under certain assumptions, the relaxations form a hierarchy starting from a big-M equivalent and converging to the convex hull. We computationally compare the proposed formulations to big-M and convex hull formulations on a test set including: K-means clustering, P_ball problems, and ReLU neural networks. The computational results show that the intermediate-split formulations can form strong outer approximations of the convex hull with fewer variables and constraints than the extended convex hull formulations, giving significant computational advantages over both the big-M and convex hull.

[2101.12709] A full characterization of invariant embeddability of unimodular planar graphs	Ádám Timár and László Márton Tóth			When can a unimodular random planar graph be drawn in the Euclidean or the hyperbolic plane in a way that the distribution of the random drawing is isometry-invariant? This question was answered for one-ended unimodular graphs in[BT19], using the fact that such graphs automatically have locally finite (simply connected) drawings into the plane. For the case of graphs with multiple ends the question was left open. We provide a graph theoretic characterization of graphs that have a locally finite embedding into the plane. Then we prove that such graphs do have a locally finite invariant embedding into the Euclidean or the hyperbolic plane, depending on whether the graph is amenable or not.	
[2101.12710] Information Causality without concatenation	Nikolai Miklin Marcin Pawłowski	thanks:	marcin.pawlowski@ug.edu.pl	Information Causality is a physical principle which states that the amount of randomly accessible data over a classical communication channel cannot exceed its capacity, even if the sender and the receiver have access to a source of nonlocal correlations. This principle can be used to bound the nonlocality of quantum mechanics without resorting to its full formalism, with a notable example of reproducing the Tsirelson’s bound of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. Despite being promising, the latter result found little generalization to other Bell inequalities because of the limitations imposed by the process of concatenation, in which several nonsignaling resources are put together to produce tighter bounds. In this work, we show that concatenation can be successfully replaced by limits on the communication channel capacity. It allows us to re-derive and, in some cases, significantly improve all the previously known results in a simpler manner and apply the Information Causality principle to previously unapproachable Bell scenarios.

Slater	Physics Department University of Ottawa Ottawa Ontario Canada K1N 6N5		When nanopores are used to capture and translocate DNA molecules through a membrane, the resulting capture rate is essentially independent of molecular size, which makes the process incapable of changing relative concentrations in a mixture. Using Langevin Dynamics simulations, we show that it is possible to design pulsed fields to ratchet captured semiflexible molecules in such a way that only short chains successfully translocate, effectively transforming the nanopore process into a low pass molecular filter. The process itself can be run with many pores in parallel, thus increasing its potential usefulness.

In this article we overview the recent theory of the superconductivity enhancement by multifractality and extend it to describe the spectral properties of superconductors on the scales of the order of the superconducting gap. Specifically, using the approach based on renormalization group within the nonlinear sigma model, we develop the theory of a multifractal superconducting state in thin films. We derive a modified Usadel equation that incorporates the interplay of disorder and interactions at energy scales larger than the spectral gap and study the effect of such an interplay on the low-energy physics. We determine the spectral gap at zero temperature which occurs to be proportional to the multifractally enhanced superconducting transition temperature. The modified Usadel equation results in the disorder-averaged density of states that, near the spectral gap, resembles the one obtained in the model of a spatially random superconducting order parameter. We reveal strong mesoscopic fluctuations of the local density of states in the superconducting state. Such strong mesoscopic fluctuations imply that the interval of energies in which the superconducting gap establishes is parametrically large in systems with multifractally-enhanced superconductivity.

However, recent research has demonstrated that the machine learning algorithms that often underlie such technology can act unfairly towards specific groups (e.g., by making more favorable predictions for men than for women). An undesired disparate impact resulting from this kind of algorithmic unfairness could diminish consumer trust and thereby undermine the purpose of the system. We studied this effect by conducting a between-subjects user study investigating how (gender-related) disparate impact affected consumer trust in an app designed to improve consumers’ financial decision-making. Our results show that disparate impact decreased consumers’ trust in the system and made them less likely to use it. Moreover, we find that trust was affected to the same degree across consumer groups (i.e., advantaged and disadvantaged users) despite both of these consumer groups recognizing their respective levels of personal benefit. Our findings highlight the importance of fairness in consumer-oriented artificial intelligence systems.	disparate impact algorithmic fairness consumer trust

We compare the different causal structures based on three key properties, namely the validity of the push-up lemma, the openness of chronological futures, and the existence of limit causal curves. Recall that if the spacetime metric is smooth,satisfies all three properties, but that in the continuous case, the push-up lemma fails. Among the proposed alternative causal structures, there is one that satisfies push-up and open futures, and one that has open futures and limit curves. Furthermore, we show that spacetimes with continuous metrics do not, in general, admit a causal structure satisfying all three properties at once.Key words:low regularity, causality theory, push-up lemma, causal bubbles.MSC-classification:53C50 (Primary) 83C75 (Secondary)	Key words:

TaylorMechanical Eng.Biomedical Eng.Electrical & Computer Eng.Carnegie Mellon UniversityPittsburgh, PA  TraversRobotics InstituteCarnegie Mellon UniversityPittsburgh, PA		bex@andrew.cmu.edu ebenjami@andrew.cmu.edu mtravers@andrew.cmu.edu	The field of DNA nanotechnology has made it possible to assemble, with high yields, different structures that have actionable properties. For example, researchers have created components that can be actuated, used to sense (e.g., changes in pH), or to store and release loads. An exciting next step is to combine these components into multifunctional nanorobots that could, potentially, perform complex tasks like swimming to a target location in the human body, detect an adverse reaction and then release a drug load to stop it. However, as we start to assemble more complex nanorobots, the yield of the desired nanorobot begins to decrease as the number of possible component combinations increases. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this work is to develop a predictive model to maximize yield. However, training predictive models typically requires a large dataset. For the nanorobots we are interested in assembling, this will be difficult to collect. This is because high-fidelity data, which allows us to exactly characterize the shape and size of individual structures, is very time-consuming to collect, whereas low-fidelity data is readily available but only captures bulk statistics for different processes. Therefore, this work combines low- and high-fidelity data to train a generative model using a two-step process. We first use a relatively small, high-fidelity dataset to train a generative model. Then at run time, the model takes low-fidelity data and uses it to approximate the high-fidelity content. We do this by biasing the model towards samples with specific properties as measured by low-fidelity data. In this work we bias our distribution towards a desired node degree of a graphical model that we take as a surrogate representation of the nanorobots that this work will ultimately focus on. We have not yet accumulated a high-fidelity dataset of nanorobots, so we leverage the MolGAN architecture [1] and the QM9 small molecule dataset [2-3] to demonstrate our approach.

To obtain a small but meaningful model, it is important to find stochastically independent variables capturing all the information necessary to model or predict the output variables sufficiently. Therefore, we introduce in this work a framework to detect linear and non-linear dependencies between different features. As we will show, features that are actually functions of other features do not represent further information. Consequently, a model reduction neglecting such features conserves the relevant information, reduces noise and thus improves the quality of the model. Furthermore, a smaller model makes it easier to adopt a model of a given system. In addition, the approach structures dependencies within all the considered features. This provides advantages for classical modeling starting from regression ranging to differential equations and for machine learning.

That is despite much progress made in recent years with ultracold atoms in optical lattices to better understand phenomena such as many-body localization or the effect of disorder on Mott metal-insulator transitions. Here, we utilize the numerical linked-cluster expansion technique, extended to treat disordered quantum lattice models, and study exact thermodynamic properties of the disordered Fermi-Hubbard model on the square and cubic geometries. We consider box distributions for the disorder in the onsite energy, the interaction strength, as well as the hopping amplitude and explore how energy, double occupancy, entropy, heat capacity and magnetic correlations of the system in the thermodynamic limit evolve as the strength of disorder changes. We compare our findings with those obtained from determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations and discuss the relevance of our results to experiments with cold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.

To what extent actual urban dynamics include an actual strong coupling between scales, in the sense of both top-down and bottom-up feedbacks, remains an open issue with important practical implications for the sustainable management of territories. We introduce in this paper a multi-scalar simulation model of urban growth, coupling a system of cities interaction model at the macroscopic scale with morphogenesis models for the evolution of urban form at the scale of metropolitan areas. Strong coupling between scales is achieved through an update of model parameters at each scale depending on trajectories at the other scale. The model is applied and explored on synthetic systems of cities. Simulation results show a non-trivial effect of the strong coupling. As a consequence, an optimal action on policy parameters such as containing urban sprawl is shifted. We also run a multi-objective optimization algorithm on the model, showing showing that compromise between scales are captured. Our approach opens new research directions towards more operational urban dynamics models including a strong feedback between scales.Keywords:Urban dynamics; Systems of cities; Urban morphogenesis; Multi-scalar modeling; Strong coupling

Parallel advancements made in microprocessor-based electronics and database software can be combined to create robust, versatile and modular experimental monitoring systems. Here, we describe a monitoring network used across a number of cold atom laboratories with a shared laser system. The ability to diagnose malfunction, unexpected or unintended behaviour and passively collect data for key experimental parameters, such as vacuum chamber pressure, laser beam power, or resistances of important conductors, significantly reduces debugging time. This allows for efficient control over a number of experiments and remote control when access is limited.

In this work we explore the dynamical impacts and observable signatures of two-fluid effects in the parameter regimes when ion-neutral collisions do not fully couple the neutral and charged fluids. We perform 2.5D two-fluid (charges - neutrals) simulations of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) at a smoothly changing interface between a solar prominence thread and the corona. The purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the RTI and the effects of the partial ionization on the development of RTI using nonlinear two-fluid numerical simulations. Our two-fluid model takes into account neutral viscosity, thermal conductivity, and collisional interaction between neutrals and charges: ionization–recombination, energy and momentum transfer, and frictional heating. In this paper (hereafter paper II), the sensitivity of the RTI dynamics to collisional effects for different magnetic field configurations supporting the prominence thread is explored. This is done by artificially varying, or eliminating, effects of both elastic and inelastic collisions by modifying the model equations. We find that ionization and recombination reactions between ionized and neutral fluids do not substantially impact the development of the primary RTI. However, such reactions can impact the development of secondary structures during the mixing of the cold prominence and hotter surrounding coronal material. We find that collisionality within and between ionized and neutral particle populations plays an important role in both linear and nonlinear development of RTI; ion-neutral collision frequency is the primary determining factor in development or damping of small-scale structures. We also observe that the degree and signatures of flow decoupling between ion and neutral fluids can depend on the inter-particle collisionality and on the magnetic field configuration of the prominence thread.

[2101.12732] Speech Enhancement for Wake-Up-Word detection in Voice Assistants				Keyword spotting and in particular Wake-Up-Word (WUW) detection is a very important task for voice assistants. A very common issue of voice assistants is that they get easily activated by background noise like music, TV or background speech that accidentally triggers the device. In this paper, we propose a Speech Enhancement (SE) model adapted to the task of WUW detection that aims at increasing the recognition rate and reducing the false alarms in the presence of these types of noises. The SE model is a fully-convolutional denoising auto-encoder at waveform level and is trained using a log-Mel Spectrogram and waveform reconstruction losses together with the BCE loss of a simple WUW classification network. A new database has been purposely prepared for the task of recognizing the WUW in challenging conditions containing negative samples that are very phonetically similar to the keyword. The database is extended with public databases and an exhaustive data augmentation to simulate different noises and environments. The results obtained by concatenating the SE with a simple and state-of-the-art WUW detectors show that the SE does not have a negative impact on the recognition rate in quiet environments while increasing the performance in the presence of noise, especially when the SE and WUW detector are trained jointly end-to-end.	
[2101.12733] On the Expressive Power of Homomorphism Counts	Albert Atserias Phokion G. Kolaitis Wei-Lin Wu	Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya Barcelona Catalonia Spain. Atserias’ research partially supported by MICIN project PID2019-109137GB-C22 (PROOFS).		A classical result by Lovász asserts that two graphsandare isomorphic if and only if they have the same left profile, that is, for every graph, the number of homomorphisms fromtocoincides with the number of homomorphisms fromto. Dvorák and later on Dell, Grohe, and Rattan showed that restrictions of the left profile to a class of graphs can capture several different relaxations of isomorphism, including equivalence in counting logics with a fixed number of variables (which contains fractional isomorphism as a special case) and co-spectrality (i.e., two graphs having the same characteristic polynomial). On the other side, a result by Chaudhuri and Vardi asserts that isomorphism is also captured by the right profile, that is, two graphsandare isomorphic if and only if for every graph, the number of homomorphisms fromtocoincides with the number of homomorphisms fromto. In this paper, we embark on a study of the restrictions of the right profile by investigating relaxations of isomorphism that can or cannot be captured by restricting the right profile to a fixed class of graphs. Our results unveil striking differences between the expressive power of the left profile and the right profile. We show that fractional isomorphism, equivalence in counting logics with a fixed number of variables, and co-spectrality cannot be captured by restricting the right profile to a class of graphs. In the opposite direction, we show that chromatic equivalence cannot be captured by restricting the left profile to a class of graphs, while, clearly, it can be captured by restricting the right profile to the class of all cliques.

[2101.12735] A discovery of a low-energy excess in cosmic-ray iron: an evidence of the past supernova activity in the Local Bubble	M. J. Boschini S. Della Torre M. Gervasi D. Grandi G. Jóhannesson G. La Vacca N. Masi I. V. Moskalenko S. Pensotti T. A. Porter L. Quadrani P. G. Rancoita D. Rozza M. Tacconi	INFN Milano-Bicocca Milano ItalyCINECA Segrate Milano Italy		Since its launch, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer – 02 (AMS-02) has delivered outstanding quality measurements of the spectra of cosmic-ray (CR) species,,, and nuclei,H–O,Ne,Mg,Si, which resulted in a number of breakthroughs. One of the latest long awaited surprises is the spectrum ofFe just published by AMS-02. Because of the large fragmentation cross section and large ionization energy losses, most of CR iron at low energies is local, and may harbor some features associated with relatively recent supernova (SN) activity in the solar neighborhood. Our analysis of the new AMS-02 results together with Voyager 1 and ACE-CRIS data reveals an unexpected bump in the iron spectrum and in the Fe/He, Fe/O, and Fe/Si ratios at 1–2 GV, while a similar feature in the spectra of He, O, Si, and in their ratios is absent, hinting at a local source of low-energy CRs. The found excess extends the recent discoveries of radioactiveFe deposits in terrestrial and lunar samples, and in CRs. We provide an updated local interstellar spectrum (LIS) of iron in the energy range from 1 MeV nucleonto10 TeV nucleon. Our calculations employ theGalProp–HelModframework that is proved to be a reliable tool in deriving the LIS of CR,, and nuclei.	cosmic rays — diffusion — elementary particles — interplanetary medium — ISM: general — Sun: heliosphere
[2101.12736] N-grams Bayesian Differential Privacy	Osman Ramadan, Microsoft,  Withers, Microsoft,  Orr**footnotemark:*, Graphcore,	footnotemark:	jawithe@microsoft.com douglas.orr99@gmail.com osramada@microsoft.com	Differential privacy has gained popularity in machine learning as a strong privacy guarantee, in contrast to privacy mitigation techniques such as k-anonymity. However, applying differential privacy to n-gram counts significantly degrades the utility of derived language models due to their large vocabularies. We propose a differential privacy mechanism that uses public data as a prior in a Bayesian setup to provide tighter bounds on the privacy loss metric, and thus better privacy-utility trade-offs. It first transforms the counts to log space, approximating the distribution of the public and private data as Gaussian. The posterior distribution is then evaluated and softmax is applied to produce a probability distribution. This technique achieves up to 85% reduction in KL-divergence compared to previously known mechanisms atequals 0.1. We compare our mechanism to k-anonymity in a n-gram language modelling task and show that it offers competitive performance at large vocabulary sizes, while also providing superior privacy protection.	
[2101.12737] Epistemic values in feature importance methods: Lessons from feminist epistemology	Leif Hancox-Li I. Elizabeth Kumar	Capital One11 W 19th StNew York New	kumari@cs.utah.edu leif.hancox-li@capitalone.com	As the public seeks greater accountability and transparency from machine learning algorithms, the research literature on methods to explain algorithms and their outputs has rapidly expanded. Feature importance methods form a popular class of explanation methods. In this paper, we apply the lens of feminist epistemology to recent feature importance research. We investigate what epistemic values are implicitly embedded in feature importance methods and how or whether they are in conflict with feminist epistemology. We offer some suggestions on how to conduct research on explanations that respects feminist epistemic values, taking into account the importance of social context, the epistemic privileges of subjugated knowers, and adopting more interactional ways of knowing.	explanation | philosophy | epistemology | machine learning | feature importance | feminism | methodology
[2101.12738] A more probable explanation for a continuum flash in the direction of a redshift ≈ 11 galaxy	Charles L. Steinhardt Michael I. Andersen Gabriel B. Brammer Lise Christensen Johan P. U. Fynbo Bo Milvang-Jensen Pascal A. Oesch Sune Toft	Cosmic Dawn Center (DAWN)Niels Bohr Institute University of Copenhagen Jagtvej 128 København N DK-2200 Denmark		Recent work reported the discovery of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) associated with the galaxy GN-z11 at. The extreme improbability of the transient source being a GRB in the very early Universe requires robust elimination of all plausible alternative hypotheses. We identify numerous examples of similar transient signals in separate archival MOSFIRE observations and argue that Solar system objects — natural or artificial — are a far more probable explanation for these phenomena. An appendix has been added in response to additional points raised in Jiang et al. (2021), which do not change the conclusion.	
[2101.12739] Secure Software Leasing Without Assumptions	XXXXXXXXAnne Broadbent Stacey Jeffery Sébastien Lord11footnotemark:1XXXXXXXX Supartha Podder11footnotemark:1 Aarthi Sundaram	University of Ottawa Ottawa Canada.	aarthi.sundaram@microsoft.com jeffery@cwi.nl	Quantum cryptography is known for enabling functionalities that are unattainable using classical information alone. Recently,Secure Software Leasing (SSL)has emerged as one of these areas of interest. Given a target circuitfrom a circuit class, SSL produces an encoding ofthat enables a recipient to evaluate, and also enables the originator of the software toverifythat the software has beenreturned— meaning that the recipient has relinquished the possibility of any further use of the software. Clearly, such a functionality is unachievable using classical information alone, since it is impossible to prevent a user from keeping a copy of the software. Recent results have shown the achievability of SSL using quantum information for a class of functions calledcompute-and-compare(these are a generalization of the well-knownpoint functions). These prior works, however all make use of setup or computational assumptions. Here, we show that SSL is achievable for compute-and-compare circuitswithout any assumptions.

[2101.12741] Post-OCR Paragraph Recognition by Graph Convolutional Networks	Renshen Wang, Yasuhisa Fujii, Ashok PopatGoogle Research{rewang, yasuhisaf,			We propose a new approach for paragraph recognition in document images by spatial graph convolutional networks (GCN) applied on OCR text boxes. Two steps, namely line splitting and line clustering, are performed to extract paragraphs from the lines in OCR results. Each step uses a-skeleton graph constructed from bounding boxes, where the graph edges provide efficient support for graph convolution operations. With pure layout input features, the GCN model size is 34 orders of magnitude smaller compared to R-CNN based models, while achieving comparable or better accuracies on PubLayNet and other datasets. Furthermore, the GCN models show good generalization from synthetic training data to real-world images, and good adaptivity for variable document styles.	
[2101.12742] An elementary 158 km long quantum network connecting room temperature quantum memories	Dounan Du Paul Stankus Olli-Pentti Saira Mael Flament Steven Sagona-Stophel Mehdi Namazi Dimitrios Katramatos Eden Figueroa	Department of Physics and Astronomy Stony Brook University Stony Brook NY 11794 USA		First-generation long-distance quantum repeater networks require quantum memories capable of interfacing with telecom photons to perform quantum-interference-mediated entanglement generation operations. The ability to demonstrate these interconnections using real-life fiber connections in a long-distance setting is paramount to realize a scalable quantum internet. Here we address these significant challenges by observing Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference between indistinguishable telecom photons produced in two independent room temperature quantum memories, separated by a distance of 158 km. We obtained interference visibilities after long-distance propagation offor single-photon level experimental inputs. This first-of-its-kind quantum network prototype connecting quantum laboratories in Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Laboratory is envisioned to evolve into a large-scale memory-assisted entanglement distribution quantum network, the basis for inter-city quantum communication.

We show that they are exactly the-representation-finite Nakayama algebras classified by Vaso. Next, we classify partially the-hereditary quadratic monomial algebras. In the case, we prove that there are only two examples, provided that the preprojective algebra is a planar quiver with potential. The first one is a Nakayama algebra and the second one is obtained by mutating, whereis the Dynkin quiver of typewith bipartite orientation.
